EDIH Name: DIH-BAITUR: Digital Innovation Hub of the Balearic Islands for Artificial Intelligence and Tourism
Title: DIH-BAITUR: Digital Innovation Hub of the Balearic Islands for Artificial Intelligence and Tourism
Country: Spain
Description: (DIH-BAITUR) is a non-profit initiative in line with the Smart Specialisation Strategy of the Balearic Islands (RIS3), which is focused on tourism and promotes other strategic sectors, such as agriculture.
Tourism is one of the fastest-growing and most dynamic industries in the world. At the same time, it is also an “anchor” industry for all others in the region.
The Balearic Islands are one of the most important and well-known tourist destinations in the world. The competitiveness of the tourism industry is directly related to the islands’ capacity to innovate and adapt to today’s new technological changes.
Disruptive technologies have a direct impact on tourism, and this impact is much stronger than in any other sector: cloud computing, IoT, BigData, 5G... So, this industry needs a digital and innovative ecosystem that will help to support the emergence of new data and the digital economy.
At the same time, tourism is a sector that is directly linked to all other industries in the region, especially agriculture. So, DIH-BAITUR brings all these sectors and industries together “under one roof,” therefore increasing the region’s level of competitiveness.
DIH-BAITUR aims to support and boost the digital transformation of companies, especially those in the tourism and agricultural sectors. This will help them to successfully face today’s global challenges, especially those related to the new data economy, and help them to become more competitive.
DIH-BAITUR is co-run by different non-profit and public entities: the cluster of technologies applied to tourism – TURISTEC, leading the creation of DIH-BAITUR together with the University of the Balearic Islands (UIB), Mallorca Chamber of Commerce, the Agricultural Cooperatives on the islands and the Regional Government of the Balearic Islands. New members to join in the short-medium termhave already been identified.
The main ambition of the Balearic Islands DIH is to become a reference model, not only for the Balearic Islands in anything related to innovation and digitisation, but also at European level for the tourism sector.
This DIH also intends to create a strong and single digital innovation ecosystem involvingnot only the tourism sector but all other sectors in the Balearic Islands, concentrating primarily on the agricultural industry. DIH-BAITUR provides services for the development of R+D projects, scaling up of innovative projects and demonstrations, and also serves as a resource for training and accelerating of start-ups with a one-stop-shop approach.

EDIH Name: DIH-bio
Title: DIH·bio (Digital Health - Biosciences)
Country: Spain
Description: Thanks to digital technologies such as AI or HPC and the massive generation of medical and other health-related data, traditional methods for early detection, diagnosis, treatment, patient management, precision medicine, drug development, genomics, or medical image analysis are being transformed. This is driving an evolution of health-related activities from a reactive approach (curing diseases) to an approach based on the P4 medicine paradigm: Predictive, Preventive, Personalised and Participatory. This conviction has driven the setting up of Digital Health-Biosciences (DIH bio). DIH bio results from long-term collaborative patterns established around the Campus of International Excellence UAM (Universidad Autónoma de Madrid) + CSIC (Spain´s Scientific Research Council) that includes leading Competence Centres focused on digital and health domains. It has joined 42 Quadruple Helix actors (industry, academia, civil society and public authorities) that have a say in Bio-Health& Digital fields: from deep-tech startups to technology MNCs, research centers, the University, hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, investors, scientific park, business associations, chamber of commerce and public authorities. Also, MoUs have been signed to create Health-related corridors with other EDIH candidates. This has allowed a holistic design of a service portfolio with a high degree of specialization and know-how focused on helping health&Bio related startups, SMEs and public entities to address the challenges of the digital transition. It will support them in using digital technologies, highlighting AI and HPC as critical tools and the relevance of cybersecurity as very sensitive information has to be managed. It also provides a comprehensive life-cycle: from matching partners for the digital transformation process to securing financial resources or training the workforce to upskill their capabilities and devoting particular relevance to TBI activities.

EDIH Name: DIHCUBE
Title: Digital Italian Hub for ConstrUction and Built Environment
Country: Italy
Description: DIHCUBE aims at establishing the Italian Digital Hub for Construction and the Built Environment. The construction industry is pivotal to the Italian economy (22% of the GDP) and to every citizen’s life, yet it is a sector that suffers from deep backwardness. This is matched by low competitiveness worsened by the recent economic crisis and difficulty in harnessing innovation. The same factors hinder the sustainable transformation of the sector. This is why the Commission has included constructions amongst the 14 priority ecosystems that face the most significant challenges in meeting sustainability goals and in embracing the digital transformation. DIHCUBE will address these issues by bringing together the most advanced research centres and the value chain of the construction industry: SMEs, professionals, suppliers of materials and technology and the public sector. The partners have been chosen to promote a systematic technological shift: they include R&I experts, the Public Sector and specialists in business innovation. Two of them are the most representative organizations of the construction sector; one of them will coordinate the project and will make available its nation-wide network to systematically engage DIHCUBE stakeholders. Given the low level of digitalization in the compartment and the high potential for digital transformation, DIHCUBE services will range from basic digital literacy to advanced pilot coaching for the use of AI and highly specialized consultancy for niche uses. DIHCUBE assistance will be offered across the whole of Italy and will consist of a complete set of services. The Hub will function as a unique access point to the EDIHs network and has already signed an agreement with 6 construction EDIH-candidates. The crisis has deeply hit Italy and the National Recovery Plan has just been deployed. The construction sector, that is central to the Plan, will be able to deliver only if it will undergo a deep green and digital transformation.

EDIH Name: DIHGIGAL
Title: Digital Innovation Hub of the Galician Industry
Country: Spain
Description: Galicia is the 6º Spanish region least digitalized, according to the DiGiX that assesses the factors that enable to fully leverage ICTs for increased competitiveness and well-being. Being 99,92% of Galician companies SMEs, there is a clear need to address digitalization at this scale. Furthermore, manufacture is not only a critical sector for the Digital Europe Programme, but it also represents almost 15% of the Galician economy. European digitalization of SMEs goes necessarily through the digitalization of the Galicia manufacturing SMEs. DIHGIGAL's goal is to boost the digital transformation of all industry focusing on SMEs and mid-caps needs. This will be achieved by the diverse composition of its consortium: *3 leading manufacturing sectors (automotive, naval and food) represented by their clusters (CEAGA, ACLUNAGA & CLUSAGA) bringing together not only their companies (20,000M€ turnover and 50,000 employees) but also their technology centres along with a cross-sectorial ecosystem (Galicia Digital) which opens the EDIH to whole industrial sector. *4 leading competence centres combining the best capacities in HPC and AI represented by CESGA-Supercomputing Centre, ITG and Universities of Vigo and Coruña (which chairs the Spanish Association for AI) along with the private supply through the ICT cluster. *3 complementary agents (FEUGA, KPMG & Inovalabs) to provide service to the entire digital ecosystem. All of them are crucial to implement specialized actions and to extend the scope and impact of the project. In this sense, DIHGIGAL is part of a broader vision aligned with policies at regional (RIS3), national, and European (2030 Digital Compass, Green Deal, and White Paper on AI) level. In terms of the foreseeable impact, over 800 SMEs, mid-caps and public entities are expected to benefit directly from the project and the collaboration with other EDIHs. This is DIHGIGAL commitment to enhance the twin transition in Galicia and, hence, the EU.

EDIH Name: DInO
Title: Digital Innovation Ostbayern
Country: Germany
Description: Rural regions can still benefit most from digitization these days, because the issues of distance and the difficult accessibility of customers and suppliers have driven existing analogue offers into the city. With the help of a comprehensive and functioning broadband network, digital services of general interest and innovative economic levels can be developed, which can create strong added value through the application of new technologies and alternative approaches. This requires the four pillars of the European Digital Innovation Hubs, especially in Eastern Bavaria: "Test before Invest" with the help of a close interlinking of science and business as well as modern open innovation and test labs, "Skills and Training" for the development of user-oriented training on topics of digital technologies and business models, "Support to find Investments" for promoting and finding suitable tenders and research projects so that innovative concepts can be financed , as well as "Innovation Ecosystem and Networking" to build a cross-stakeholder network for digitization and to transform Eastern Bavaria into a leading digital region. The intervention logic of the project takes up the existing competencies of the partners and applies them to the needs of the companies and institutions in the region. The main topics on AI and data-driven technologies, digital business models as well as cyber security, functional safety and HPC addresses the thematic needs and applies them to the dominant sectors of the region (industry with a focus on the construction sector and manufacturing, trade, startups and municipalities). The choice of focus was especially tailored to the needs of regional Small and medium Enterprises (SME) but also Public Sector Entities (PSE).
