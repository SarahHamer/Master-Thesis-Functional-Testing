EDIH Name: CICERO DIH
Title: DIGITAL INNOVATION HUB DEL LAZIO: CICERO HUB S.C.A R.L.
Country: Italy
Description: Cicero is part of the Digital Innovation Hub network of Confindustria, the main association representing manufacturing and service companies in Italy. Cicero operates mainly in Lazio, the region where the capital Rome is located, supporting industries in their digitalization process and acting as a point of contact with European initiatives for SMEs digitalization and innovation. Cicero provides services for: - Digital Maturity Assessment – Deep assessment of SME/PSO digital readiness using a specific tool and interviews, providing a process-oriented score (from 1 to 5) of digital maturity measured with respect to some macro-processes: design & engineering, production management, quality management, maintenance management, logistics management, supply chain management, HR management, marketing & sales management. Each process is analysed trough five dimensions: Execution, Monitoring and Control of Processes, Technologies, Organizational Structure, and Skills. This phase allows an in-depth analysis of company characteristics, internal dynamics, operational methods, and processes adopted in the company and it is functional to the analysis of needs and objectives in order to outline the most appropriate technological solutions for the company's digital innovation. - Digital evaluation process - This activity is carried out with the creation of a high-level roadmap for the digital transformation of business processes together with the support to the company in the scouting, evaluation and matching of digital solutions compatible with the results of the two previous steps. The roadmap defines the strategic objectives of the SME’s or PSO's digital innovation path. Once the business objectives have been established, the technological objectives are defined, in support of which are identified those of skills development, project implementation, ecosystem development and access to finance. The roadmap also identifies any support needs in the field of governance and project management. The last phase of the digital assessment process is a preliminary design of the interventions based on an analysis of the technological equipment and business models of the organization, accompanied by an estimate of the times and costs of each adaptation intervention, as well as a hypothesis of possible forms of financing. Knowledge and technology transfer – Consulting activities to support SME/PSO to navigate in the Industry 4.0 paradigm and in the AI technologies. Cicero Dih offers a wide range of consulting services through a data analytics process, the effectiveness of which is greater the greater and more accurate the data on the organization is. Communicating the knowledge to industry and public administration is a key aspect of Cicero strategic objectives. Cicero DIH is involved in several and important initiatives at regional, national, or European level, aimed at digitizing the Country. Keywords: All sectors consultancy, process and technological consultancy

EDIH Name: CITAH
Title: Cross-Industry Transformation in Agriculture and Health
Country: Germany
Description: The proposed EDIH “Cross-Industry Transformation in Agriculture and Health” (CITAH) implements the idea of regionally effective lead industries and activates agri-food and health as innovation domains in Northwest Germany (NUTS-2 region DE94, Weser-Ems) that drive the cross-industry development of innovative technologies as well as their adaptation and diffusion. CITAH institutionalizes a focal point, firstly for regional transfer between cutting-edge research and practice, secondly for cross-industry adaptation, through which “hidden champions” from different sectors benefit from active knowledge exchange, and thirdly for leveraging the potential of cross-border services through digitalization. CITAH positions itself as a centre for the regional innovation ecosystem by providing services in four fields: • Integration of prototypes and products into the innovation laboratories for agriculture and health, both for testing under almost real conditions and for demonstration to potential (cross-domain) customers. • Training and knowledge transfer on technological competencies (artificial intelligence, interoperability, cybersecurity) and their domain-specific implementations and regulations, • Advisory in financing digitization activities, • Networking of stakeholders from the two addressed industrial domains with information technology companies to form strategic alliances and ecosystems. CITAH builds upon the successful work of the Centre for Digital Innovation in Lower Saxony (ZDIN), founded in 2019 by the state of Lower Saxony, Germany, to institutionalize the process of digital transformation). Through its partnerships, CITAH addresses around 600 companies in the direct regional business environment as well as a multiple in the indirect environment through nationwide multipliers such as Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Chamber of Crafts, German Electrical and Electronic Manufacturers' Association and Federal Office of Consumer Protection and Food Safety.
