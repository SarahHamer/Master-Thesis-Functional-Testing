EDIH Name: DIH4CAT
Title: Catalonia Digital Innovation Hub (DIH4CAT)
Country: Spain
Description: DIH4CAT targets Catalan SMEs (with a special focus on manufacturing companies and technology providers), technology start-ups, and public administrations. Catalonia has a strong industrial base, with 35,339 companies (99% SMEs) which represent 18,1% of Spanish industrial enterprises. Data from 2019 shows that only 16% of those companies had adopted advanced digital technologies. Additionally, Catalonia counts more than 1,700 start-ups, (66% of Industry 4.0), facing challenges such as access to technology infrastructure, time to market and investment. In this context the Digital Innovation Hub of Catalonia (DIH4CAT) is born, as a non-profit regional innovation ecosystem formed by the main agents supporting digitisation in Catalonia and connecting the main technology infrastructure of the region to make them available for SMEs, start-ups, and public administration, with the objective of accelerating technology transformation towards a more green and digital industry. The consortium is led by the Government of Catalonia and composed of 7 technology partners (RTOs and university) leading the 7 technology areas (AI, HPC, Cybersecurity, Robotics, Photonics, 3D Printing and Connectivity), 1 business school, 2 employer’s industrial associations. It is complemented with 19 Associated Partners so far which include, among others, private companies contributing with infrastructure and know-how. DIH4CAT has a clear focus on test before invest services but complements its offer with services related to innovation, ecosystem, digital skills, access to finance and business. The Consortium has also a very well-defined collaboration strategy at an international level, developed through the presence in most relevant European networks, participation in more than 50 previous relevant projects, 5 MoUs specifically developed for this call, to develop common infrastructures/services, and seamless collaboration with EEN (Catalan node is also coordinated by ACCIÓ).

EDIH Name: DIH4GlobalAutomotive
Title: DIH4GlobalAutomotive
Country: Portugal
Description: The DIH 4 GLOBAL AUTOMOTIVE proposes to assume as the Digital Innovation Hub of the Automotive Sector in Portugal, arising from the aggregation of a set of entities and companies, coordinated by MOBINOV, with the objective of providing support services to SME to support the (necessary) digital transformation of the value chain, both at the product and process level, positioning existing companies and start-ups in the future of mobility. Its main objective is to work at the level of the development of innovative concepts and products for the Car of the Future, supporting the SMEs in the automotive sector in the development of new components for this car and, mainly, to support the necessary changes to the production processes associated with Industry 4.0 and the concept of Factory of the Future. It also intends to act as an access point to the European network of EDIHs, helping local companies and/or public actors to get support from other EDIHs in case the needed competences fall outside their competence, ensuring that every stakeholder gets the needed support wherever it is available in Europe and provide services to SME from other countries presented by other EDIHs that need their expertise. The diagnoses made with SMEs, point to the importance that digital technologies will be used increasingly in all car systems, so DIH resources will also be able to be mobilized in a transversal way, so that services can be provided with maximum flexibility and versatility. The DIH will act as an intermediary of innovation in the automotive industry and its value chain, seeking to provide through the provision of advanced digital services and technologies aid and support to companies in their digital transformation processes, providing a set of services such as testing before investing, skills development and training, support in the search for investment funding, partnerships and networking for the innovation ecosystem.

EDIH Name: DIH4Society
Title: Digital Innovation Hub for a Smarter, Safer and more Sustainable Society (DIH4Society)
Country: Romania
Description: News: 
 launched the call for selecting the SMEs who will benefit from the services. Details & info are available: https://dih4society.ro/apel-imm/
Accelerating digital green transformation and innovation uptake across the economy and society is at the forefront of Europe’s growth agenda. Digital Innovation Hubs (DIHs) are one of the pillars to uphold this process and will help to consider the geographical (regional) dimension and thematic context to boost SME growth, citizen centered governance, jobs and investment. The COVID19 crisis has demonstrated the absolute necessity of having strong European digital ecosystems as key enablers to avoid disruption in value-chains. However, digitalization and digital transformation can only be efficient if digital ecosystems are strongly interlinked with their applied market sectors. Due to inertia and/or legacy, the manufacturing, public administration and health sectors are among the most challenging ones. The project Digital Innovation Hub for Society for a Smarter, Safer and more Sustainable Society comes to upscale the services that DIH4Society can deliver in the North-West Region of Romania and aims at fully integrating our initiative into the European network of hubs. The project focuses on two technological pillars, cybersecurity and smart robotics, while also building advanced digital competencies for digitalization and green digital transformation. Upon finalization, the project will have a profound, transformative impact on a regional level through the digital progression of 70 key stakeholders, public administration and health providers, and more than 400 SMEs from smart specialization sectors. DIH4Society will provide a European solution to a European challenge and will bring or embed digitalization in the practices of many organizations. In the long run the project will inspire a new generation of early adopters of technologies, new entrepreneurial initiatives of visionary companies and organizations that use cutting edge technologies at the core of their business models and will build the foundation for a citizen centered public service delivery.

EDIH Name: DIHBAI-TUR
Title: Digital Innovation Hub of the Balearic Islands in Artificial Intelligence in Tourism and the Agrifood sectors
Country: Spain
Description: Being islands, the region of the Balearic Islands faces important challenges when it comes to digitalisation. DIHBAI-TUR was born with the objective of being an umbrella for all actors representing the Balearic Islandsâ€™ digital and innovation ecosystem, and therefore it is the only DIH in the region. DIHBAI-TUR will use tourism, as the main industry, to leverage other industrial sectors, with a special focus on Agrifood, in their digital transformation process while becoming a reference model in Artificial Intelligence applied to tourism. Addressed mainly to SMEs, DIHBAI-TUR offers a sound catalogue of services that combines training, networking, test before invest and access to funding actions. DIHBAI-TUR has already promoted the creation of a specific network of DIHs for islands (iSLANDIHS). It is part of the most important DIH networks, and it is working to create a DIH network specialising in tourism. All these networks, the contacts made, and our experience will contribute to the EDIH. As a very active DIH, DIHBAI-TUR will contribute and participate in the activities foreseen by the DTA, reinforcing the role of Europe as a worldwide leader in tourism thanks to digitalisation and therefore help to accelerate tourismâ€™s recovery. Train for trainers activities will be an important tool to transfer knowledge to the territory of the Balearic Islands through a sound ecosystem that will be managed under the umbrella of DIHBAI-TUR. DIHBAI-TUR presents a solid workplan based on five interrelated Work packages aimed to offer dedicated and focused services to SMEs and public bodies with the final objective of increasing the number of companies our DIH provides services to, improving their digital maturity and, therefore, their competitiveness and productivity, as well as offering services that go from the most basic digital requirements to the most advances ones, combining the knowledge and expertise of all the entities that are part of the DIHBAI-TUR Consortium.
