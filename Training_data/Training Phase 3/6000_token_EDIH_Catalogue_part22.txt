EDIH Name: EDIH NN
Title: European Digital Innovation Hub Northern Netherlands
Country: Netherlands
Description: The Northern Netherlands (NN) finds itself at the junction of all the big transitions. Digitalisation is essential to follow through with these. Considering this, our region has the potential to make sizeable progress if it can successfully roll out widespread digitalisation. 
As a hardcore transition economy, the NN may even join the European frontrunners and act as an example for other regions. It is from this challenge that the NN will start with the European Digital Innovation Hub (EDIH NN). We have chosen to specialise in the area of Autonomous Systems, which includes multiple digital technologies that are relevant for the four transitions in the NN: (1) Smart Agro, (2) Smart Manufacturing, (3) Life Science and Health and (4) Utilities, Built Environment and Mobility. In the first three-year EDIH NN wants to support more than 750 companies and lay the foundation for long-term support of all companies. 
The building blocks for EDIH NN are: 

A Brokerage network that will identify issues regarding digitalisation and relay these to Solution Providers (high TRL) and knowledge providers (low TRL).
A Test Before Invest network (test and demo facilities) comprising 20+ organisations that will invest in Autonomous Systems within their domain, and collaborate towards becoming a European testing ground.
A Smart Factory Accelerator to strengthen the digital maturity of companies.
An Empowerment programme to strengthen companies in the areas of DEP Technologies: Cyber Security and Artificial Intelligence.
An approach based on High Performance Computing to make digitalisation more accessible.
The Smart Makers Academy: A programme aimed at matching supply and demand around digital skills, based on individual learning outcomes.
A Funding Readiness programme to help companies that need to invest for their digitalisation strategy, in finding funding opportunities.
A network to stimulate supply and demand around Autonomous Systems.

EDIH Name: EDIH OCCITANIA
Title: To boost an ethical and sustainable digital transformation to improve competitiveness and resilience, and foster the use of space data specially for agri-food, mobility and health sectors
Country: France
Description: The EDIH OccitanIA consortium gathers 14 partners to accelerate and accompany SMEs digital transformation. Its overall strategic goal is to create a unique entry-point for companies, to support their digital shift to fully exploit the potential of data, in a decompartmentalized, secure and ethical way, and to offer them direct access to the most advanced expertise, services, skills and training resources and technologies in the field. 
Building on the regions position as a European leader in space and on this sectors capacity to provide high-value technological solutions useful for the digital transformation across other sectors, the project focuses on the data challenge, by developing services focusing mainly on:

Artificial Intelligence (AI), 
High-Performance Computing (HPC), 
Cybersecurity, 
and Spatial data and technologies 

Supporting strong regional sectors with high potential regarding the use of spatial technologies: the agri-food sector, that encompasses water challenges, the mobility sector and Intelligent Transportation Systems, and the Health sector. OccitanIA proposes an added value approach for supporting companies in their digital transition, in the form of two different journeys according to their maturity level.

EDIH Name: EDIH OVA
Title: EDIH Ostrava
Country: Czechia
Description: The project of the European Digital Innovation Hub Ostrava (EDIH Ostrava) is designed to accelerate the digitalisation of companies and public organizations in the region and at the same time to offer an attractive opportunity to use the unique interconnection of digital infrastructure and know-how to interested companies, especially small and medium-sized enterprises in the EU. The technological specialization of EDIH Ostrava is tied to the core facility of High-Performance Computing (HPC), complemented by an experimental industrial testbed. These capacities will be primarily aimed at testing and experimentation of challenging tasks for cases in sectors related to the implementation of the Industry 4.0 concept. This "technological" DNA of EDIH Ostrava is further naturally determined by the industrial character of the Moravian-Silesian Region (MSR), where EDIH Ostrava will mainly operate. The project includes a comprehensive offer of individual services and other activities in line with the required functions of the European Digital Innovation Hub. The aim is to cover a wide range of stakeholders with regard to their level of digital readiness, from entities not yet determined to exploit the potential of digitalisation to entities ready to use the most advanced digital techniques and state-of-the-art research infrastructure, including HPC. Implementation of EDIH Ostrava will provide a significant upgrade the activities that this hub has been gradually developing for several years. An ambition of EDIH Ostrava is to become an inspirational and useful hub within the networks to which EDIH Ostrava is or will be linked. This ambition builds on the existing activities of both members of the consortium and their role within the regional, national, and European innovation ecosystem and is reflected, among others, in the expected share of clients outside the MSR region.
