EDIH Name: EDIH4UrbanSAVE
Title: EDIH for urban interconnected supply and value Ecosystems
Country: Germany
Description: Hamburg is not only an important european logistics and business location, but also an award-winning "Smart City" in the sense of an European innovation metropolis. In its function in the metropolitan region of Hamburg, it fulfills an important economic, but also geographic bundling function, in which intermodal transport, logistics, industry, and (public and private) infrastructure providers are concentrated in a confined space and interact with each other. The EDIH4UrbanSAVE "EDIH for urban interconnected supply and value Ecosystems" will be both aligned with the specific economic and geographic conditions of the location and its needs in the future, as well as developed in line with innovation policy in accordance with the Smart Specialization and Regional Innovation Strategy (RIS3) of the metropolitan region. In particular, the requirements for critical infrastructure will change considerably, so that new technological solutions must be evaluated and implemented, whether in the area of cybersecurity, AI, HPC, or digitalization. This is exactly where the portfolio and network of the Hamburg EDIH comes in: Provide services that will enable the ecosystem to invest in these technological solutions, let it be, new traffic and logistics concepts, which will be supplemented by, for example, autonomous vehicles or also drone technologies, or also innovative autonomous logistics node concepts. Thus, the EDIH services will supply specific formats that will combine the technological areas with use cases and requirements of these innovations. Due to the well established beneficiaries, the Hamburg EDIH consortium has sufficient maturity to establish the innovation ecosystem at the location in a target-oriented manner and to comprehensively map the role of an EDIH required by the EU. Years of working in the innovation ecosystem of the metropolitan provides the project partners with experience and target group access.

EDIH Name: EDIH-AICS
Title: European Digital Innovation Hub applied Artificial Intelligence and Cybersecurity
Country: Germany
Description: European Digital Innovation Hub applied Artificial Intelligence and Cybersecurity (EDIH-AICS) aims at advancing the vision of a secure and sustainable European artificial intelligence technology in the fields of production, mobility, energy, commerce & services as well as public administration to strengthen their competitiveness and to bring benefits to society. While technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Cybersecurity (CS) are becoming game changer for products, services and business models, especially SMEs are not yet ready to implement such technologies. Addressing this gap the EDIH-AICS is being set up to help companies and public sector organisations (PSO) with their digital transformation. The EDIH-AICS consortium, consisting of research institutions, transfer organisations, regional economic agencies, business networks and clusters, builds on a long-term experience in digital technologies and is deeply rooted in the regional, national and European ecosystem. The EDIH-AICS project will: • operate as a one-stop shop and as a coordinated group of organisations with complementary expertises in AI and CS, to meet the digital transformation needs of SMEs and PSOs in the fields of test before invest, skills & training, access to finance and innovation ecosystem & networking activities, in Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany as well as across Europe. • attract new stakeholders (SMEs, mid-caps, PSOs) to implement digital technologies by targeted outreach activities via own networks and multipliers (e.g. EEN). • maintain and intensify long-term relationships with key players on the local level (e.g. chamber of commerce, SME associations) and act as a reference point for AI & CS within the regional, national (EDIH-AICS integrates the German de:hub applied AI) and European ecosystem. • collaborate with other EDIHs and the Digital Transformation Accelerator to provide AICS expertise to the network and find the best support for ‘customers’ across Europe.

EDIH Name: EDIH-CONNECT
Title: A European Digital Innovation Hub for Construction powered by Electronics, Artificial Intelligence & Information and Communication Technologies.
Country: Belgium
Description: In EU-27, the Construction sector represents 25 million workers, 9,6% GDP, 6,4% of total employment and 5,3 million companies for a total of 101,1 b€ turnover. But the sector faces major challenges for the coming years. With 40% of EU energy consumption, 36% of CO2 emissions and only 1% of renovation rate, the sector must massively invest in the green transition keeping in mind that we spend 90% of our time indoor and 97% of the housing stock is (energy) inefficient. The digitalisation of the sector provides a tremendous lever arm to increase the productivity and respond to this green transition but companies lack information, confidence, skills and access to finance to invest in digital. Studies indicate that digital transformation in the Construction sector can result in productivity gains of 14 to 15 percent and cost reductions of 4 to 6 percent. To respond to economic imperatives and increase the digital maturity of its companies, the construction sector has pulled out all the stops to commit itself to the innovation dynamic driven by Digital Europe and proposes the creation of a European Digital Innovation Hub (EDIH) dedicated to Digital Construction (“CONNECT”) in Wallonia. The project will be based on four pillars (test before invest, skills and competences, innovation eco-system and financial support) and articulated around AI, IoT, robotics and more generally data-driven technologies applied in Construction. As the EC recognised the Construction as a priority industrial ecosystem, the EDIH CONNECT will deeply contribute to this strategy and will specifically tackle the low adoption rate of digital by SMEs and the public administration in Wallonia and in the Construction sector in general. It will also enable Walloon companies to export their know-how within a European dimension, while promoting the digital transformation of a sector that is important for the Walloon economy (13% of added value, 17% of total private employment).

EDIH Name: eDIH-DIZ
Title: DIGITAL INNOVATION ZONE EDIH - MANUFACTURING & SMART HEALTH for better business, life and health in the North East Romania region
Country: Romania
Description: eDIH-DIZ is a 9 partners consortium covering North-East Romania and aims to support successful and sustainable digital and green transformation of the region by strengthening the capacities of the only fully-operational DIH Digital Innovation Zone in the region. Since Romania in general, and the North-East region in particular, ranks 27th out of 27 member states in the EU DESI profile for the past years, and the region's competitivity is on the last place in Romania and one of the worst 10 performers in the EU, the successful functioning of an EDIH will directly impact the Digital Europe programme strategic objectives to support achievement of EU digital targets. A complete set of EDIH services will be provided in order to: - support local SMEs (mainly from manufacturing & healtchare) and public healthcare institutions increase their digital maturity through targeted programs, - offer them access to relevant test before invest and experimentation facilities for Artificial Intelligence and other key enabling technologies, and their use cases in healthcare and manufacturing, - help them develop internal capabilities (employee upskilling) that will lead to successful digital transformation, while guiding them to overcome access to finance barriers, - connect the region with the EDIH EU network, by developing corridors for missing regional expertise, - create synergies for the region with the EIT Health network, other EIT KICs, Enterprise Europe Network, prestigious research & innovation organizations in the field of AI, - continuously grow the community by integrating relevant stakeholders, for the benefit of the region and of the target group. Consortium strength (academia, technology transfer, research, policy maker entities, target group representatives and digital private actors) will lead to EDIH target achievement for 2021-2023 and set the right ground for further developing hub outreach, sustainability and regional impact beyond the project end.
