EDIH Name: sustAIn.brussels
Title: Creating a lever for a future-proof and sustainable economy for Brussels enabled by AI and other emerging digital technologies
Country: Belgium
Description: The industrial tissue of the Brussels-Capital Region (BCR) consists of 99.7% of SMEs and has a high concentration of digital and service-oriented companies. Digital technology is the major driver of their innovations. Nevertheless, these companies perform slightly below the European average on the uptake of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and finish third last in using ICT for environmental sustainability. This specific context justifies the launch of a European Digital Innovation Hub (EDIH) in Brussels. It will act as single point of access for companies to sustainable digital innovation, enabled by AI and other emerging technologies. Based on the local industrial needs and in line with the policies of the Brussels-Capital Region, the following strategic objectives have been defined for the EDIH: - Encourage and facilitate digital innovation for economic, social and environmental transition - Contribute to the post-Covid recovery - Strengthen Brussels’ leadership in artificial intelligence - Be a gateway to Europe, promoting and enriching Brussels’ expertise and industry - Facilitate digitization of the Brussels’ industry This proposal brings together all necessary elements to implement a successful EDIH in Brussels: - A thematic focus that translates into a balanced and flexible service portfolio to support the regional SMEs to improve their (future) competitiveness. - A strong support from the Brussels-Capital Region that aspires to be frontrunner in Belgium and Europe. It will co-finance the EDIH for 50% during the next 7 years with an amount of 2.1M€ for the first 3 years. - A lean and experienced consortium that can deliver the services in 3 different languages (French, Dutch & English) and set up European corridors and reach out to other EDIHs. The EDIH will be implemented by 5 complementary innovation actors in Brussels being Agoria, Sirris, BeCentral, ULB and VUB. It will reach 1500 companies.

EDIH Name: Sweden Secure Tech Hub by Sweden ICT
Title: Sweden ICT – a constellation of six of Sweden’s leading Science Parks, have joined forces to accelerate impact towards a green and sustainable future by using new technology on a broader scale
Country: Sweden
Description: Sweden ICT is a non-profit consortium with Sweden’s 6 leading ICT-focused science parks. The proposed EDIH project will further strengthen Sweden ICT as the go-to hub/ecosystem for achieving significant capability-building and progression in secure digital transformation. Secure digitalization is critical. The increasing rate, magnitude and cost of malicious cyber-attacks in recent years have become the biggest threat to sustaining the forthcoming digital transformation, in the private and public sector. Paradoxically, Sweden is ranked very high in digitalization and has significant expertise in cyber security on a national level – but there is in the private and public sector a significant lack of up-take and deployment of secure digital processes, technologies and solutions. For the national efforts to have an impact, there needs to be orchestrated, effective, and large-scale work on the local/regional level to raise awareness, build capacity, and support tangible progression towards secure digital transformation. And this is exactly what the Sweden ICT EDIH project is designed to provide. Established in 2019, Sweden ICT covers the whole of Sweden and includes clusters of more than 2400 member companies with more than 60,000 employees. In addition, via partners, Sweden ICTs reach increases to approx 50 000 SMEs. This wide reach is also reflected in the project KPI:s – e.g more than 13000 SMEs and public organizations will benefit from at least one of the 17 distinct services offered by Sweden ICT EDIH. Thus, Sweden ICT EDIH delivers secure digital transformation on a larger scale and at a faster pace. With a project set-up containing identical regional customer journey support processes executed at 6 regions, and coordinating work-packages across these processes, the project achieves significant economies of scale – e.g by aggregating a large number of needs analyses, developing joint communication efforts and delivering a joint portfolio of services.

EDIH Name: SYNERGiNN EDIH
Title: Digital Innovation Hub of Western Macedonia
Country: Greece
Description: The Digital Innovation Hub of Western Macedonia (SYNERGiNN EDIH: SYNergy – enERGy – iNNovation) will offer its services in the region of Western Macedonia. The region of Western Macedonia, as a former lignite mining area, is very likely to face for decades deep structural unemployment, with unconceivable consequences in the local economy and eventually on the people and their communities. According to the National Energy and Climate Plan, one of the key sectors to diversify economic activities and boost the development in the region is Environment and Energy. Taking these into account, the consortium aims to establish SYNERGiNN EDIH that will guide the companies and the public organisations into utilising Artificial Intelligence, Cybersecurity, Internet of Things, and Big Data analytics, in order to promote and transform the “know-how” that the region of Western Macedonia possesses in the Energy and Environment sectors as well as replace the lignite deposits by a longer lasting knowledge deposit. Application areas that the members of SYNERGiNN have relevant expertise and experience in the Energy and Environment sectors are the following: (i) smart grids, (ii) predictive maintenance, (iii) process optimisation, (iv) energy management services, (v) Industry 4.0, (vi) circular economy and bioeconomy, and (viii) smart city applications. SYNERGiNN will provide test before invest, skills and training, support to find investment, and innovation and ecosystem networking services. SYNERGiNN hub’s headquarter will be located in a 1,000 square meters building in Kozani, owned by the University of Western Macedonia. SYNERGiNN consortium combines multidisciplinary competences and resources. It consists of fifteen partners representing one university, one research institute, two technology providers, three clusters, five industrial partners, one public regional organisation, and two chambers. SYNERGiNN has access to over 15,000 SMEs in Western Macedonia through its members.
