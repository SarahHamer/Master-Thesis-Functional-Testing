EDIH Name: EDIH Digital Trust
Title: The European Digital Innovation Hub for digital trust and emerging digital technologies
Country: Liechtenstein
Description: With the adoption of digital technologies rapidly increasing, citizens are also leaving a stronger footprint in the digital world. At the same time, AI-based applications leverage the ability to integrate independent data trails from citizens for commercial use. But, this technological evolution is being ignited by the trend among customers to protect their data. Therefore: digital trust matters. The EDIH for Digital Trust in Liechtenstein aims to address this need for privacy by promoting digital innovations that set decentralization and data protection against centralization and intrusiveness. While data protection laws in Europe have often been resented as rigid, we see an exciting opportunity to promote digital technologies, solutions and business ideas that enable more digital trust between businesses, public institutions and citizens. That's why our EDIH focuses on four areas that inherently support this vision of greater digital trust: blockchain-/distributed ledger technology, regulation of emergent technologies, cybersecurity, and digital business model innovation. Our EDIH's service landscape covers the full SMEs journey from ideation through design/prototyping iterations to implementation of digital technologies and helping to find financing. The service landscape builds on the strong network of digital-liechtenstein.li, which offers leading expertise in the selected technological areas, accompanied by experience in supporting SMEs to implement digital technologies. Together, these strengths open up a fertile ground for SMEs to innovate, creating a competitive advantage for Europe in global markets.
