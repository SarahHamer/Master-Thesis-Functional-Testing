EDIH Name: EDIH-EBE
Title: European Digital Innovation Hub - Energy in the Built Environment
Country: Belgium
Description: The EDIH-EBE focus is on sectoral coverage on Energy in Buildings and Districts, and as such, positions itself with focus and specialism for digitalisation within sector-coupling between Construction, Energy and ICT.
Its main objective is to act as a central access point, a “One-stop-shop” in providing range of services with the ultimate goal to support SMEs and public sector organisations towards successful digital transformation.
The ‘hub’ is based on the strong mobilisation of the excellent competences/expertise and infrastructure/facilities already available in Flanders.
Customers are supported with knowledge and expertise in (forward looking) digital technologies, trainings to increase competences in skilled work force, networking/info sessions/matchmaking events for improving awareness and bringing together actors of supply and demand in digital solutions, access investments for cost of equipment and software, and testing and experimenting environment to experience benefits leading to higher productivity, better technical performance, new business models and services.
Given the EDIH-EBE specialization, the support offered and the target market segments’ economic activity, it has a high potential for direct impact on the goals of the European Green Deal in terms of positive environmental effects and contribution to the reduction of carbon emissions, efficient use of resources, higher productivity and improved technical performance and business cases.
Specific objectives are to:▪ Have a specific focus & sectoral coverage on Energy in Buildings and Districts, at level ofindividual buildings, interaction of energy flows between buildings, and interaction with the energy grid. As such, it positions itself with focus and specialism for digitalisation within sector-coupling between Construction, Energy and ICT.
▪ Provide support for several Digital Technologies: Artificial Intelligence (AI), High PerformanceComputing (HPC), Cybersecurity, Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud computing, Building Information Management (BIM), Big Data, Datasets, Data analytics, Simulation/Software, Digital Twin. The overarching motivation is stimulating use of these technologies, withinbusiness/functions to improve products, processes, productivity and services.
▪ Position itself as facilitator for uptake of advanced digital technologies and theiraccelerated use in the construction industry. Embracing digital technologies in the energydomain in the built environment is essential for energy efficient construction and renovation ofbuildings/districts, with increased digitalization in the built environment being seen as muchnecessary step (e.g. ‘Renovation Wave’). Many Flemish companies (and elsewhere in Europe)are lagging in digital skills and are in need of knowledge, skills and experience to increase theirdigital maturity level, making the urgency very high of providing them with necessary support.
▪ Establish fully operational ‘One-Stop-Shop’ in the Region of Flanders (Belgium)incorporating all necessary functionalities for smooth functioning of the EDIH Services.The hub is based on strong mobilisation of the excellent competences/expertise andinfrastructure/facilities already available in Flanders. It is also based on strong mechanisms for networking and matchmaking within its innovation ecosystem as well as collaboration of EDIH-EBE across Europe, namely through benefiting from networking and collaboration within the EU-EDIH- Network and relevant competences and capacities built up in the context of the Digital Europe Programme.

EDIH Name: EDIH-GE
Title: EDIH Grand Est - Accelerate digitalisation of manufacturing sector in Grand Est
Country: France
Description: Fostering the digitalization of SMEs and Midcaps is a major objective of regional policies of Region Grand Est (S3, Regional scheme for economic development, innovation, and internationalization,), which is the third most industrialized French region. To do so, the regional authorities have defined a transformation pathway for companies and set up a digital cluster (GET Digital), managed by Grand E-Nov+, the regional innovation and attractiveness agency, that brings together the key public and private stakeholders. Furthermore, the GE territory hosts national and European renowned technology platforms regarding IA, cybersecurity, HPC, and immersive technologies. Nevertheless, these digital infrastructures and expertise have not sufficiently benefited regional companies, due to the poor connections and weak organized links between digital platforms and SMEs from key sectors. The objective of the EDIH GE is to create a one-stop-shop hub to foster the digitalization of industrial SMEs and midcaps (automotive, engineering, mechanics, textile,...), that require support regarding identification, testing, and integration (training, funding) of advanced technologies such as AI or cybersecurity, and HPC in industrial processes. With a budget of 3.8 ME, EDIH GE will deliver services (170 TBI, 500 Trainees, 16 networking events (320 participants), and 80 funding services) in three years to at least 300 companies. To deliver this strategy, GEN+ will coordinate a consortium of 11 partners that gathers 7 Universities and Engineering schools, two TTOs that manage 19 platforms and provides advanced training services, and the regional chamber of commerce that will be active to detect and qualify use cases in SMEs and mid-caps. The EDIH GE partners will be plugged into the DTA, with EEN (GEN+ and CCI GE are members) and with French and European EDIH all along its 770km of borders. EDIH GE will be co-funded by Region Grand Est (40%) and private resources (10%).

EDIH Name: EDIH-SH
Title: European Digital Innovation Hub Schleswig-Holstein
Country: Germany
Description: The European Digital Innovation Hub Schleswig-Holstein (EDIH.SH) aims to increase sustainability by creating new or novel digital solutions at process and product level using digital innovation. Economic, ecological and social aspects must be taken into account to be able to systematically evaluate those possible gains and implement them. Digital innovations will be created here through the interaction of a wide range of players from business, government and other relevant stakeholders. Key areas of focus are artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance computing (HPC), cybersecurity, Internet of Things (IoT), sensor technology, interoperability and deeper digitalisation. The co-creation based approach is an interactive and reflexive process in which a range of possibilities in those key areas are explored and translated into concrete innovation projects. The EDIH.SH will accompany the process from the generation of innovation potentials and ideas, examination of those ideas for economic and technical feasibility, to the creation of technical implementation concepts and the first prototypical implementation. The EDIH.SH offers funding and financing possibilities and individual consulting as the implementation of innovative ideas in new products, processes and services requires a high financial effort. With its free services, the EDIH.SH focuses on small and medium-sized enterprises as well as public administration organisations from the maritime and life science sectors, which are particularly significant for Schleswig-Holstein.  The digital platforms established as part of the EDIH.SH ensure the efficient collaboration of all stakeholders in joint R&D activities, idea generation and projects. The focus is always on enabling or shaping the successful transfer of expert knowledge into real value creation. A consortium of universities and the IB.SH will pool their expertise and resources to drive innovation in Schleswig-Holstein.
