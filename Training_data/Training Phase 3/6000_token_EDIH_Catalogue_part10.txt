EDIH Name: CLOTEX-HUB
Title: EDIH Clothing Technology and Textile Hub
Country: Ukraine
Description: European Digital Innovation Hub of Clothing Technology and Textile (CLOTEX-HUB) aims to increase the competitiveness of garment manufacturing products of small and medium-sized enterprises of the Khmelnytskyi region of Ukraine due to the digitisation of clothing manufacturing and the introduction of innovative technologies to ensure the product’s entry into the European market, thus integrating into international chains of creating added value of products and services.
CLOTEX-HUB operates within the ecosystem of a sewing cluster factory, providing high-added-value services for experimentation, access to training, technological infrastructures and financial support through a dynamic and interconnected ecosystem, firmly committed to becoming a relevant player in the EDIH network, expanding its collaboration outreach to other European regions. Khmelnytskyi ranks in the top ten in clothing manufacturing in Ukraine, representing over 1000 registered SMEs. The “Development Strategy of Khmelnytskyi Region for 2021-2027” states that the region's smart specialisations are defined as follows: food industry, light industry, mechanical engineering, and metalworking. In the field of light industry in the Khmelnytsky region, where CLOTEX-HUB operates, a smart specialisation is textile and clothing production. On the other hand, innovation capacity and digitalization intensity are still ranked rather low at the European level.
EDIH CLOTEX-HUB will contribute to increasing the efficiency level in the sewing industry and machine-building sectors of digital transformation, giving priority to (i) clothing business entities operating in the Khmelnytskyi region of Ukraine and (ii) the implementation of main digital technologies (Advanced Digital Skills, VR/AR technologies, Artificial Intelligent, and Cybersecurity).
The consortium consists of four Beneficiaries (Khmelnytskyi National University; NGO Agency for Sustainable Development “ASTAR”; PU “Podillia Fashion Cluster”; NGO “IT CLUSTER OF KHMELNYTSKYI”).

EDIH Name: CROBOHUBplusplus
Title: CROatian Industry and Society BOosting – European Digital Innovation HUB
Country: Croatia
Description: Europe is at the beginning of biggest transformation in history, and it is all based on understanding that the way we use limited natural resources for maintaining and improving our living standard in Europe and in the world has come to an end. It is crucial to start improving business and society but to do it on more sustainable and innovative way through digital and green transformation. Based on this notion the crucial aspect that we don’t have is time but on the other hand through all data it shows that knowledge, infrastructure, and experience is existing, but it is insufficiently connected, facilitated and focused throughout Europe and this is why we need more networked approach. In that context we see European Digital Innovation Hub (EDIH) CROBOHUB ++ as an ecosystem of excellence that is specialized in three key areas of the Digital European Program (DEP): 1. Artificial intelligence, 2. Cybersecurity, 3. High-performance computing. Our intention is to form the core of a coherent package of services that will support SMEs that intend to harness the digital and green transformation with focus on the following sectors: 1. Manufacturing industry, 2. Digitized agriculture, 3. Energy and environment as well as to help 4. Public administration to become more agile and data driven. EDIH CROBOHUB++ will be a non-for-profit hub acting in the NUTS2 region HR04 "Continental Croatia" with national scope. The support will be provided in the following technologies: Blockchain, Computer vision, Digital simulations, Embedded control and automation systems, IoT, Robotics and Smart sensors. The support will take the form of various types of services as Financial and business consulting, Knowledge and technology transfer, Pre-investment testing: integration and adaptation of technologies, digital testing, demonstration activities, Networking between companies or with users and technology suppliers and training&skills development in different digital&busines competencies.
