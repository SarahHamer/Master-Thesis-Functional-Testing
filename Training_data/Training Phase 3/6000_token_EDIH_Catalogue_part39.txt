EDIH Name: nZEB Smart Home DIH
Title: nZEB Smart Home DIH
Country: Greece
Description: The nZEB Smart Home DIH, coordinated by CERTH's Information Technologies Institute (ITI), was established in early 2017 as the first Hub in Central Macedonia, and has been fully operational ever since. The nZEB Smart Home DIH is an active liaison between research and the markets, acting as a driving force for empowering market-oriented stakeholders with innovative digital solutions. The Smart Home’s technological orientation goes over multiple vertical domains, with special focus on Robotics (commercial or prototype units available for use, integration with devices and sensors, advanced manipulation and control features added), Artificial Intelligence (e.g. intuitive perception and cognition for robotic systems), Cyber physical systems (e.g. embedded systems), Internet of Things (e.g. connected devices, sensors and actuators networks), Simulation and modelling, Big Data, Blockchain, Visual Analytics, and more. One of the unique merits of the DIH is the actual nZEB Smart Home infrastructure. It is a unique Building based on state-of-the-art construction materials (insulation, glass panes, etc.) with "smart" technologies that allow the exploration of various ICT research domains, such as Robotics and Assisted (Tele-) Heath services, or optimized energy efficient building management while simultaneously automating Renewable Energy Sources use. The Smart Home infrastructure is used as a pilot program for validation / testing of new technologies and services provided by the research community. It is equipped with a multi-sensorial network that measures in real-time almost all parameters that consist open challenges for a modern home / workplace (energy, occupancy, health, etc.). In 2019, the IsZEB Cluster emerged from the funded support program "Clusters for promoting innovation in local entrepreneurship." from the Regional Operation Programme Central Macedonia 2014-2020. The Cluster has special focus on the Construction sector, aiming to provide tools and guidelines for the entire lifecycle of a smart zero or positive energy building. Comprised of 16 members, including the leading Greek companies and authorities in the field of Smart Energy Buildings, it operates on the triple helix model, providing R&D services, training & education opportunities, ecosystem development, and innovation management The evolution of the nZEB Smart Home into the IsZEB Cluster marks a strategic progression in fostering innovation and collaboration. Building upon the success and expertise of the nZEB Smart Home initiative, the IsZEB Cluster seamlessly continues its mission, bringing together a diverse array of stakeholders. This transition represents a significant step forward in advancing the economy of smart buildings, facilitating research and development services, ecosystem development, and innovation management for businesses ranging from startups to SMEs and industrial entities. The IsZEB Cluster, maintaining the esteemed attribute of a testbed infrastructure inherited from the nZEB Smart Home, plays a pivotal role in driving collaborative projects and initiatives, creating a dynamic ecosystem for the development of the construction sector. European Initiatives: • Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe: The IsZEB Cluster participates in various EU-funded R&D projects, aimed at advancing sustainable and innovative solutions in the field of smart and zero-energy buildings (e.g. D2EPC, Response, Accept, EUH4D, metabuilding, InCube, SmartLivingEPC, SUSTAIN Eurocluster, SmartSquare). Accordingly, the nZEB Smart Home participates in various H2020 covering diverse technological domains, from robotics and artificial intelligence to energy-efficient buildings and smart healthcare solutions (Plug-N-Harvest, encompass, Greensoul, ACTIVAGE, GHOST, ACROSSING, INTEGRIDY, VICINITY, DELTA, 3DMicroGrid, eDREAM, DRIMPAC, DIH^2, AI DIH Network, SIT4Energy, AMANDA, AI4EU, DIHNET, BIMERR, MEISTER, PLANET, SMILE, IRIS, AIREGIO, SmartLivingEPC and much more) By participating in those projects, IsZEB Cluster & nZEB Smart Home DIH not only stay at the forefront of technological advancements but also play a crucial role in shaping the EU research landscape. These collaborative endeavours allow them to leverage their expertise, state-of-the-art infrastructure, and multi-sensorial network to contribute with valuable insights and solutions to the various projects. • European Digital Innovation Hubs (EDIHs): The IsZEB Cluster and the nZEB Smart Home participate in the EDIHs, specifically engaging with the Synerginn EDIH and the SmartHealth EDIH. As part of the EDIHs, they operate as a Service Provider, offering a state-of-the-art rapid prototyping and novel technologies demonstration infrastructure, providing a tangible asset for businesses, start-ups, and research institutions to test and showcase emerging technologies. National Initiatives: • Smart Specialization Strategy (RIS3): Since its beginning, the nZEB Smart Home was linked with the RIS3 strategy. The RIS3 supported specialization sectors are correlated to Information & Communication Technologies, Energy Applications/Technologies and Microelectronics – Advanced Materials. The activities interrelate mainly to the investment of creation and dissemination of new knowledge and to the investment in Research & Innovation in the above topics. • Co-Financed by Greece & EU (Central Macedonia Initiatives): IsZEB Cluster was established due to its participation in the programme "Cooperative formations for the promotion of innovation in local entrepreneurship". Its purpose was to promote innovation in local entrepreneurship, foster the sharing of facilities and equipment, and encourage the exchange of knowledge and expertise, networking, dissemination of information and cooperation between companies and other organizations of the cluster.
