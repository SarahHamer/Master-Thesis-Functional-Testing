EDIH Name: Nemonoor
Title: A Norwegian EDIH on Artificial Intelligence
Country: Norway
Description: European private and public companies are lagging other regions in exploiting how advanced digital technologies can contribute to better services and more effective/efficient processes and business models.
Contributing to this challenge is our dependence on technologies from other regions, and the importance of our collective effort to succeed in becoming greener.
The Digital Europe Program will complement other EU Programs by helping private and public companies develop capacities in utilizing High-Performance Computing, Artificial Intelligence, Cybersecurity, Advanced Digital Skills in accelerating the best use of technologies in tackling these challenges.
One of the mechanisms deployed through Digital Europe is the European Digital Innovation Hubs. Nemonoor is a Norwegian consortium of eight partners with a long-standing history of collaboration and joint efforts, that has been designated by Norway to become an EDIH.
Our belief is that the challenge at hand can only be solved through collaboration among partners that have deep knowledge and experience within all aspects of how private and public companies approach digital, and how they build their capabilities and exploit the opportunities.
Our approach is based on two main objectives:

support SME/public sector enterprises in Norway with AI Adoption, and
ensure EDIH synergies on the European and national levels.

Nemonoor partners have a long history of mobilizing private and public companies to act, and to build their capabilities to deploy the technology.
With the Nemonoor consortium in place, we have the best means to scale on what we are already doing and release further national and EU funding to activities that contribute to growth and prosperity for European companies and citizens.
The application gives a comprehensive description of our capabilities, how we will utilize these capabilities, and how we will engage and assist companies in taking part in the digital transformation journey.
