EDIH Name: DIS-HUB
Title: Digital Innovation Hub South Tyrol - DIS-HUB
Country: Italy
Description: DIS-HUB (Digital Innovation Hub South Tyrol) is an Italian mature Hub which will fully cover NUTS 2 Region of South Tyrol. The 13 partners have a strong experience in the fields of research, education, innovation, technology, and business services, ensuring a complete set of services to the targeted companies. The heart of DIS-HUB is the technology park of the Region, the NOI Techpark, which is equipped with all the research infrastructures and skills needed: 40 research laboratories, 1 business incubator, 90 tech-companies, 3 Faculties of the University, 4 research institutions. This gives an outstanding advantage in terms of capabilities and outreach. The main objectives of the project are (i) to set up a EDIH in the Region of South Tyrol, (ii) connect it with the EDIH Ecosystem and (iii) to deliver the foreseen services for the target groups, fully in line with Digital Europe Program strategy. DIS-HUB will have a multi-sector technology focus in the field of sustainable agri-food systems, sustainable buildings and energy & water systems, smart rural areas (with special focus on mobility and tourism) and smart manufacturing. DIS-HUB is specialized on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the related enabling technologies, such as real-time data management, recommender systems, prediction models, computer vision, robotics. DIS-HUB has the ambition to make the region of South Tyrol an open testing environment, in which companies can test their prototypes with real customers and end-users. In the first three years DIS-HUB plans to serve around 420 unique companies. DIS-HUB will actively contribute to European policies and especially to the EU Data Strategy, thanks to the implementation of an open “data space” covering all specialization fields. DIS-HUB expects to gain know-how in other technology fields through the cooperation with other EDIHs and is engaged to promote synergies with other relevant partners, in particular with Enterprise Europe Network (EEN).

EDIH Name: DMH
Title: Digital Marine Hub
Country: Italy
Description: DMH aims at promoting and facilitating the digital transformation in the nautical and yachting sector, with specific attention both to vessels and infrastructures: boatbuilding, maintenance, and operations. Although the nautical sector is a market in continuous growth in the last eight years, in spite of the pandemic, design and production process in the sector are still MH aims at promoting and facilitating the digital transformation in the nautical sector and in the boat's construction in particular. The rationale behind the choice is that, although being a market in continuous growth in the last eight years, in spite of the pandemic, the design and production processes in the sector are still rather traditional. The size of the companies, often very small, together with the highly customized products hamper the introduction of new technologies. The introduction of digital technologies in the sector has a strong potential in terms of innovation of the products and of the production processes, thus reducing costs and improving competitiveness. But in this historical period, the strong concern about climate change and the particular attention towards the emission reduction from the waterborne sector represent further drivers for the introduction of new solutions enabling reduced GHG emissions and more environmentally friendly products and production processes, in the context of the circular economy. DMH will offer services mainly in HPC and AI techniques. The project gathers together large Universities and Research institutions, a worldwide relevant computing center, SME, business incubators and business angels, technology clusters and industrial associations, an NGO in the field of sustainable development of the Mediterranean. The proposed Hub is widely distributed in Italy with its strong presence in the Italian regions where the concentration of the potential users is the highest and those have the maritime sector as one of the smart specialization strategies.

EDIH Name: EasyHPC
Title: easyHPC@eco.plastics.industry.WCG:An open HPC ecosystem for the ecological transformation and the advancement of the competitiveness of the Plastic Industry in the Regions of West & Central Greece
Country: Greece
Description: At “easyHPC” we aim at the digital and ecological transformation of the plastics and packaging industry in Greece. We want to create an open and viral ecosystem, where people can meet, communicate, acquire skills, and respond to industrial challenges or market impulses through open innovation, agility, experimentation, and co-development. We aspire to pave the way to industrial advancement, resilience, and green footprint reduction.
“easyHPC” means for us ‘easy’, ‘digestible’, ‘flexible’, ‘awareness creation’. ‘HPC’ comes from “High Performance Computing”. The fundamental principle underpinned by easyHPC@eco.plastics.industry.WCG, as it is the integral name of the Hub, is the application of supercomputing (HPC) based strategies for Industry 4.0, combined with infrastructure adjustment, high scientific and technological training, advanced knowledge, and pioneering simulation algorithms developed by leading Greek Scientific and Research Laboratories.
In the plastics industry, the material itself is the major problem to face. It does not follow standard and conventional processing rules (industry 4.0 cannot effectively work as a ready to buy black box). Thus, from a rheological perspective, one needs high research and technological competence to handle plastics materials in product design and process development. In this sense, the global experience has shown that HPC simulations and modelling at the Molecular, Mesoscopic, and Macroscopic level, are the most advanced solutions to manage production parameters and conditions to achieve quality and avoid waste. This phenomenon scales up when one comes to the use of bio-based and recycled materials with unknown properties or non-uniform behaviour, which differ significantly from those of original, unprocessed polymers. Furthermore, as EU and society press for sustainability and green growth (consider the microplastics problem at sea and air), modelling and simulated design are of paramount importance.
“easyHPC” has its headquarters in Patras, Greece with a national geographical scope. It is a triangular collaborative initiative between: Several Labs from the Departments of Chemical & Mechanical  Engineering, Computer Science, Mathematics and Educational Sciences at the University of Patras and the University of Piraeus; Patras Science Park (PSP), a leading regional incubator and ecosystem supporter for innovative start-ups, and; The Association of Greek Manufacturers of Packaging and Materials (AGMPM) that represents a large number of manufacturers alongside the whole materials value chain, products and applications used in our day‑life.
In addition, “easyHPC” has the support of leading European Plastics Innovation Competence Centers, as well as other related industry organizations such as the ‘Plastics Recyclers Europe’, the ‘Association οf Greek Soft Drinks Industries’, or the ‘Federation of Hellenic Food Industries’. “easyHPC” already collaborates with other four leading EDIHs in similar and complementary fields of expertise.
The Hub endeavours to offer its customers a full range of services. Activities are organised around 4 technical and business-related modules, coupled with management, communication, dissemination and exploitation utilities. The objective is to provide companies an exciting “journey” map and framework to first design, develop and produce new materials with inherent ecological and functional characteristics, using a state-of-the-art production and software platform. Then improve competencies through advanced digital engineering courses, workshops, collaborative projects, student internships programs, and technical business publications.
In collaboration with market experts, create structural and long-last partnerships with leading European sectoral competence and research centres, as well as network with industry ecosystems and communities. Finally perform market and technology intelligence and seek for the most appropriate funding and investment opportunities.
