EDIH Name: EXPAND
Title: EXtended Piedmont and Aosta valley Network for Digitalization
Country: Italy
Description: EXPAND aims to become one of the recognized European hubs able to provide digital evolutionary services such as testing before investing, training and skills development, support to find investments, networking and access to innovation ecosystems, according to the DIGITAL-2021-EDIH-01 call expectation. The project targets the digital transformation needs of Companies and Public Authorities in the Piemonte and Valle d’Aosta (VdA) area. The proposal is strongly focused on the specific topics of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Cyber-security (CS), notwithstanding - due to the nature of the consortium - all the ICT panoramas can be covered and integrated, with regard on other key enabling technologies like advanced robotics, extended reality, internet of things, additive manufacturing, next generation network, distributed intelligence, and many other. Within the project a list of 50 services was drawn up, organized by categories, daily cost and duration: the EXPAND strategy is to provide some free of charge services (all for PA, some for the enterprises) and a sub-set of services via a clearly defined final cost: the rationale behind this is to guarantee the full commitment of the entities requiring support. The project is open to all the companies with a focus on the manufacturing and industrial ecosystem, paying particular attention to those who develop or deploy technologies with a positive impact, directly or indirectly, on the environment and sustainability. The filtering of requests will take place thorough an open, transparent, and non-discriminatory mechanism, creating a selection funnel: initially will reach the maximum potentially interested audience and then will start the vis-à-vis discussion and actuhe EXPAND (EXtended Piedmont and Aosta valley Network for Digitalization) is the application of the Piedmont - Valle d’Aosta cluster to the selection for one of the node of the forthcoming EDIH European network in the context of the Digital Europe Program.

EDIH Name: FAIR
Title: Finnish AI Region
Country: Finland
Description: Finnish AI Region EDIH (FAIR) provides free or subsidized services to SMEs to advance their digital and green transformation on an open, transparent and non-discriminatory basis. The technological focus of FAIR is on AI, but we also offer expertise in cybersecurity, high-performance computing, and Extended Reality (XR). Geographically, FAIR services cover the whole Finland with emphasis on Southern Finland. At the core of FAIR are 1) the Finnish Center for Artificial Intelligence (FCAI), which is a flagship initiative founded and run by AALTO, UH and VTT, and 2) the three major capital region cities (Helsinki, Espoo and Vantaa). FAIR has deeper collaboration with selected EDIHs in Finland and in Europe, but intends to collaborate with and strengthen the whole EDIH network. Furthermore, FAIR collaborates with other Finnish organizations and networks. Thus, FAIR will be able to offer an extended set of services.  
Our target customers are SMEs operating in the areas of digital services, smart cities and health. These SMEs are expected to have at least a basic understanding of AI. A typical example of a customer is a company that is already an established player in its own application area and now aims to launch a new product/service harnessing AI, but lacks the expertise and means to correctly validate, implement, maintain and further develop the new AI based service in practice. It can also be a company that aims to improve its operations with a third-party AI solution, but does not have the needed expertise to compare available services nor to implement them efficiently.

It implements Finland's national AI strategy and action plan https://www.tekoalyaika.fi/en/ launched 2017.
Our mission is to create Real AI for Real People in the Real World—a new type of AI, which is able to operate with humans in the complex world—and to renew the Finnish industry with the new AI.

FCAI is a coordinated effort aiming at researching and developing

AI solutions that bring AI systems closer to human cognition; we do not attempt to clone human cognition but provide ambitious and realistic technical solutions
AI solutions that can be used by people, as companions and assistants, and guided by the people; in other words, AI that is understandable, trustworthy, and applied ethically, and AI that with its new capabilities can understand and interact with humans
AI solutions that work with scarce data, in the real world, where large labeled training data sets are rare and current AI solutions would not perform efficiently

The FCAI is aligned with the regional (Helsinki-Uusimaa Region) and the national (Finnish) strategies for digitizing the industry. In the region, FCAI can support industry renewal by utilizing the opportunities provided by digitalization and ICT as well as big data. FCAI enables developing value chains and business operation in order to renew the companies.
