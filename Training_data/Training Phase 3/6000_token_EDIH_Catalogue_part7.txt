EDIH Name: Cantabria DIH
Title: Cantabria Digital Innovation Hub (DIH)
Country: Spain
Description: Cantabria DIH is an initiative led by the Regional Government that brings together key players in the regional innovation ecosystem. The consortium that promotes Cantabria DIH is a balanced sample of the main regional Competence Centres, business associations, chambers of commerce and also public entities. This approach ensures a fully alignment of Cantabria DIH 's value proposition on based of the digital transformation needs of Cantabrian companies. The application areas on which the Cantabria DIH will be focus (health and well-being, Industry 4.0 and cultural industry and sustainable tourism) and its associated sectors are consistent with the priorities formulated in the Smart Specialisation Strategy - Cantabria RIS3, and its evolution for the current multiannual financial framework. These economic activities have a large potential for improving their competitiveness and exploit its full potential by relying on digital technologies. Thanks to the excellent capabilities of the consortium members, Cantabria DIH will make key digital technologies available to regional companies, such as Artificial Intelligence, High Performance Computing and cybersecurity. Services based on these technologies, together with other key digital technologies, will form the basis of the portfolio of services to be offered by Cantabria DIH. The customers of Cantabria DIH will be mainly regional companies. However, the impact of the activities to promote digital transformation goes beyond this region. The internationalisation of Cantabria DIH's activity will be supported by a network of collaborations with other EDIHs that have complementary capabilities, mentioned in the proposal. The activities developed by the Hub over the next three years are expected to directly accelerate the digital transformation of almost 250 companies. The additional investment to be mobilised is estimated at €1.26 million.

EDIH Name: Carpathian EDIH
Title: Carpathian EDIH: pursuing dual transformation (digital & green transition) in the western regions of Ukraine
Country: Ukraine
Description: Carpathian EDIH (EDIH) aspires to spearhead a dual transformation (digital & green) in five regions in the West of Ukraine: Ivano-Frankivsk, Chernivtsi, Zakarpattia, Ternopil and Volyn. Our mission is to increase competitiveness of the local economy to prevent brain drain to the bigger cities of Ukraine and abroad. For that, we will empower for- and non-profit organizations guiding them in the adoption of Advanced Digital Technologies, through Business Support Services, Test-Before-Invest, Skills Development, and Community Building. We’ve designed our services to form a smooth customer journey, from need assessment to profound monitoring & evaluation. Aligned with the region's Smart Specialization, priority sectors include manufacturing (Processing Industries, Light Industries, Construction, Energy) and service industries (Hospitality & Tourism, Creative Industries & Media, Education). Core technological pillars encompass Cybersecurity, AI & Machine Learning, Cloud Computing, Robotics & Cyber-Physical Systems, and Gamification. Moreover, our dedicated focus is on Green Tech & Sustainable Construction, crucial for Ukraine's post-war recovery; as the safer western region of Ukraine now is acting as a test bed for innovative approaches for future reconstruction of the frontline territories. The Hub’s infrastructure will thus include a Sustainable Construction Center with a specialized Green Tech prototyping facility, alongside three other facilities: Robotics, Multimedia Technologies, and a general-purpose prototyping facility. For this ambitious initiative, we have forged partnerships with key stakeholders, including educational institutions, business development agencies, professional organizations, local government, and ICT providers. Together, we aim to unlock the region's innovation potential and effectively integrate into the European network, leveraging technology for collective prosperity.
