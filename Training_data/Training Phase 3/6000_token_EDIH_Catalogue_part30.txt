The proposal leverages on two important initiatives promoted in Basilicata region: the House of Emerging Technology (HET), the main technological infrastructure the City of Matera has made available to the project for designing, prototyping and testing of new products, and the Talent’s Academy promoted by Basilicata Region, based on the Apple Academy of Naples model: an advanced and multidisciplinary training platform, that thanks to the synergies with HSL, will be further specialised on the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI), High Performing Computing (HPC) and Cybersecurity (CS) to CH&CCIs, with the goal to attract talents, upskill and reskill personnel, create a new generation of professional with strong and up–to–date digital competences. The Hub of Matera, with the 2 spokes in Naples and Bari, will represent an innovation triangle in the sector of CH&CCIs, rooted in Southern Italy, active in the European and Mediterranean context and strongly interconnected with the global innovation ecosystem.
