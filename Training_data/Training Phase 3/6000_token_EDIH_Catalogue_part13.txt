EDIH Name: DIGI2Health
Title: DIGI2Health
Country: Czechia
Description: DIGI2Health is a collaborative project established to address the need for systemic changes in healthcare both within and outside the Czech Republic. It also aims to provide technical and knowledge support for innovations in healthcare. Its core founding members are Palacký University Olomouc, Faculty Hospital Olomouc and Olomouc Region Innovation Center. Recently, the project was relocated to a separate facility because we firmly believe that a crucial aspect of innovation is in-person interaction and ideation. This new facility, Envelopa Hub, now serves as the home not only for project partners but also for innovative companies and student organizations. It provides a dedicated co-working space and experimental laboratories that align with the mission and vision of the project. The project follows the structure of digital innovation hubs defined by the European Commission and is listed in the DIH catalogue. In addition to the main partners of the Digi2Health innovation hub described in detail above, it is worth noting that the hub heavily relies on its other members and collaborating partners. These entities provide us with insights and access, including but not limited to private healthcare, such as Agel - a leading private healthcare provider in Central Europe (https://eu.agel.cz/index.html), and specialized organizations like the Alliance for Telemedicine (https://www.atdz.cz/poslani-a-cile), which brings together key stakeholders in the fields of telemedicine and the digitalization of health and social services. Laboratory of DIGI2Health can offer to SMEs experimental laboratory for devices used in healthcare. For example simulating patient movement in surgeries through technology Wi-Fi kit for indoor UWB signal monitoring, climate chamber for testing electronic devices or electroimpedancy tomograph with 16 chanells.

EDIH Name: DiGiNN
Title: Cyprus DIGital INNovation Hub
Country: Cyprus
Description: DiGiNN will introduce a new level of support toward the digital transformation of Cyprus, as the country needs urgent action to address its digital maturity levels. DiGiNN aspires to become a one-stop-shop for all companies and public sector organisations, providing them an end-to-end experience in their digitisation journey; from coaching and mentoring by reputable experts, access to the most advanced infrastructure and facilities, support to find investments, to networking and access to innovation ecosystems. To achieve this, we gather the local champions in digital technologies, including all relevant Centres of Excellence, and partner them with both National industrial representation bodies and sectoral associations, thus establishing the direct interface between state-of-the-art offer and broad demand. Blending in are the most active incubators, whose mission is to nurture innovative start-ups in the early stages of commercialisation and support them in terms of upskilling, networking and accessing funds for further development. Finally, DiGiNN will orchestrate a number of groups and clusters, introducing representatives of the quintuple helix to ensure that our motto “Leaving no one behind” drives our activities throughout the project and creates the conditions for sustainable digital development of the local ecosystem. Furthermore, DiGiNN takes it one step further than just being an excellent service provider and facilitator; High in our agenda is to develop a “Digital culture” among the National economy actors, by creating the appropriate ecosystem and developing working relations between the country’s economic actors and the experts who can enable the digital transformation of private (SMEs) and the public sectors in Cyprus and Europe. This will not only drive demand, but ensure that the ecosystem continues to operate and develop once the EC and local funding is no longer available at the end of the 3+4 year period.
