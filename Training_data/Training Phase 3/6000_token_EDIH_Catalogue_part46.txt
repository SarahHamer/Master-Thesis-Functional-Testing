EDIH Name: Smart Secure Cities
Title: Creating Smart Secure Cities for EU citizens
Country: Poland
Description: The Smart Secure Cities Consortium’s aim is to continue its up-to-date activities as a national EDIH with specialization in Smart City/IoT responding to a national need to foster digitalization and introduction of smart technologies, in line with national smart specializations for Poland. There is a great need for fair, cyber-secure, inclusive, resource-efficient, and above all human-centric digitalization of EU citizens’ living environments. However, there is not enough specialized support for the cities to make digitalization successful, especially in CEE. Our EDIH will address those needs working for and with two types of clients: Public Sector Organisations and SMEs. Thanks to its synergy, unique competencies, a well-planned, geographically balanced network of 28 Consortium members coming from different regions of Poland, will be a driver to raise the CEE region and level up with the most innovative regions in Europe. Consortium with its expertise and experience in digitalization will bring education, raise awareness on benefits and tools for a well-conducted digitalization. With its highly innovative, testing infrastructure of cyber-physical Innovation Showroom SMEs, start-ups and PSOs will be able to present and test the most innovative Smart City/IoT technologies. EDIH will support access to financing for the European cutting-edge technologies. It will also foster tight cooperation and networking between PSOs and SMEs in their digitalization to create together sustainable smart cities in the EU. EDIH will also address aims, promote and implement the concept of introduction of smart technologies as tools for sustainable development addressing directly objectives of the European Green Deal and Fit for 55 strategy. Our EDIH will continue to be a driver of the EU-wide network of EDIHs active in the area of digitalization of EU cities and regions involving EU-funded platforms and programs such as EEN, Startup Europe Partnership, Innovation Radar, EIC Accelerator.

EDIH Name: SMIH 3D - Smart 3D Industry Hub
Title: SMIH 3D - Smart 3D Industry Hub
Country: Croatia
Description: "SMart Industry Hub – SMIH” is an industrial cluster consisting of over 20 Croatian and Slovenian companies (18 SMEs of which 3 start-ups and 1 research organisation and 1 ecosystem partner) that have very significant expertise in mechanical and electrical engineering, information technology as well as in the so-called fourth-generation industrial revolution. The cluster has existed for 10 years and has operated under the name “3D grupa – klaster 3D tehnologija”. With the development of 3D technologies, there was a need to join forces in order to ensure a more rapid adoption and application of 3D technologies in industry and science.
The primary mission of HUB is to increase the competitiveness of local and regional industries by promoting the use of concurrent 3D technologies in their business processes and to provide support and know-how in the following areas:

Providing access to 3D technology and enabling companies to test the technology on resolving their problems
Providing quality and structured 3D industry-related information to regional companies and institutions
Ensuring support for implementation of 3D technologies in business processes of the regional industry
Digital transformation
Business innovation and strategies development
Prototyping
Education coupled with mentoring
Linking regional industry with international partners
R&D activities
B&B networking

The overarching goal of SMIH is to enable cooperation of all key stakeholders of the HUB that contribute to strengthening the industrial potential and competitiveness of domestic industry. Through this collaboration we aim to develop investments in new technologies, innovative products with export potential and high added value. The SMIH's founders and members are constantly working on improving the existing infrastructure as well as building a new one.
At the present moment, SMIH represents a modern technologically advanced "HUB" providing answers to most questions related to the industry in a broader sense.
SMIH brings together more than 40 external experts in terms of support for research and development activities in 5 areas of industry and science: natural, technical, biomedical, biotechnical, and architecture and construction.
HUB works passionately on the identification of new products within its ranks, as well as their development and commercialization. It also works on research, development and innovation programs and projects of its members.
Through our non-profit activities, we strive to share and distribute the valuable knowledge residing within the HUB network through regular free seminars on 3D technologies, dissemination of information and transfer global industry trends to regional business and educational entities. Furthermore, the Cluster promotes assemblies, exhibitions and similar events and arranges visits to professional fairs.
In order to achieve its goals and to be able to complete set tasks, the HUB established a regional reference centre for 3D technologies, where we gathered a significant amount of various equipment from the field of 3D technologies for use in everyday industry projects, for educational purposes and for raising technology awareness.
At the same time, SMIH enables young engineers to get acquainted with the equipment and gain realistic work experience.
SMIH has leveraged its broad experience in the field of 3D technologies, to build a tailor-made educational framework. The entire range of industrial occupations, from machine operators, technicians to engineers is driven in pursuit of new knowledge and skills necessary to respond to the challenges of the modern industry. Within our daily work, we are involved with the most relevant companies from various industry sectors: automotive, aerospace, consumer goods, power generation, transportation, medical and dental. As these companies will benefit the most from finding skilled employees to engage, we are using our network to communicate all benefits of the project and get all stakeholders involved.
SMIH – in cooperation with academia and “Callidus, Institute for adult education” established the „3D Academy for 3D Technologies” which currently operates in West Balkan region focusing on transferring knowledge and skills required in today’s labour market. The programmes of 3D Academy are accredited by the Ministry of Science, Education and Sports and the German Chambers of Commerce Abroad. The HUB has also established strong connections with regional Universities.

Finally, SMIH offers digital transformation, business innovation and strategies development, prototyping, education, mentoring, and B2B connection, assistance in the acceptance and implementation of cutting-edge technologies and trends, support in corporate innovation management and integration into the tech community.
