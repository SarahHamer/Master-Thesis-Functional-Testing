EDIH Name: DigIT Hub Sweden
Title: DigIT Hub Sweden
Country: Sweden
Description: DigIT Hub Sweden is built on the solid foundation of DigIT Hub, the existing regional DIH in Skåne and Blekinge that has been in operation since 2020. The EDIH includes the neighbouring region Kronoberg, meaning DigIT Hub Sweden will reach a larger target group and leverage the synergies of the three southernmost regions of Sweden, with all EDIH actors within 2 hours travel time.
The overall objective for DigIT Hub Sweden is to:• Increase and accelerate growth and productivity by digitalisation for SMEs in the manufacturing industry• Catalyse and drive digital transformation in the public sectorThe thematic focus of DigIT Hub Sweden - Smart Manufacturing & Smart Cities - is tightly coupled with the smart specialisation strategies of the three regions and thus addresses their digitalisation needs. It also enables pooling of digitalisation expertise resources in the regions that support DigIt Hub Sweden's objectives. Our EDIH is home to world-leading Internet of Things (IoT) technology, fuelled by strong research institutions in radio communications and microelectronics in close symbiosis with large companies in the mobile phone industry and tech. The specialised focus of DigIT Hub Sweden is thus found at the intersection between Smart Manufacturing, Smart City and IoT. DigIT Hub Sweden also has strong knowledge in the DEP prioritised technology areas of AI, Cybersecurity and HPC, with already established partnerships both on national and European levels. DigIT Hub Sweden enjoys strong support and financing from the regional governments as well as major municipalities. Tech cluster Mobile Heights is the project coordinators. Other relevant cluster organisations, science parks, public sector organisations, major universities and research institutions are key partners in the EDIH. In addition, major manufacturing and tech companies play an important part to ensure a strong connection to industry.

EDIH Name: Digital Hub Logistics
Title: Digital Hub Logistics
Country: Germany
Description: In the Digital.Hub Logistics in Dortmund we accompany and advise SME and large corporations on both the digital transformation of the company and on developing digital business. All this in a region that has already proven how well it deals with structural change and in an environment which benefits from its proximity to Germany's best logistics research facilities.
Today, logistics stands for intelligent networking and is predestined to push forward digitisation in industry, trade and production. The best way to push forward the development oDortmund and the Ruhr metropolitan area are among the most important logistics locations in Germany and are renowned as innovation hubs for logistics in Europe. Scientific institutions like Fraunhofer IML, Fraunhofer ISST and TU Dortmund University with their specialist chairs and industry-related lead-projects have bundled competencies in the areas of logistics and digitisation in recent years and have established new forms of cooperation between business and science. Digital.Hub Logistics now closes the gap in the innovation chain between pre-competition research and launching product ideas onto the market. f digital projects, products and services, particularly in companies which still mostly have material assets, is with so-called »start-ins« – i.e. special digital teams or units that deal with innovations above and beyond normal daily business and outside the company’s usual product development process. Our Digital Transformation Guides accompany your »start-in« all the way from the initial inspiration to scale-up – whether you just want to use your product internally, offer it on the market or even found a new company. 
In our Digital Product Factory, we offer a wide variety of service components which you can use to lead your project to success. These are proven concepts for innovation management, e.g. potential analyses, workshops or focus groups, as well as formats from the start-up scene such as bar camps, pitch nights or hackathons. Step by step, and together with you, we select exactly the right service components to meet your specific requirements. 
Our Coworking Space is in Dortmund, opposite Fraunhofer IML and very close to Fraunhofer ISST, providing direct access to the test halls and experimental areas, shop floors and laboratories in the two research institutions. The close proximity to the TU Dortmund University LogistikCampus also ensures we have excellent contacts to young logistics talent. 
The employees at Digital.Hub Logistics Agency see themselves as Digital Transformation Guides: we support and foster developments, initiate processes, advise and accompany you in your activities, input the necessary know-how just when it is needed and connect you to the right partners.
