EDIH Name: Centre for Advanced Manufacturing Technologies, Wroclaw University of Science and Technology
Title: Centre for Advanced Manufacturing Technologies, Wroclaw University of Science and Technology
Country: Poland
Description: Research areas and competencies of CAMT are within the most recent development, manufacturing and informatics systems trends known not only in Poland. A broad extent of carried out research programmes and implementation projects assures a constant technological improvement and enhances the scientific and research potential of CAMT – over the centre's existence (since 2000) it has grown from 16 to 76 employees (2 full professors, 3 associate professors, 28 assistant professors, 23 postgraduates and 23 scientific-research workers, paid of commissions and projects). This trend is highly conducive to establishing a close cooperation with industry and enables to carry out research projects in national and international associations – several projects within the frame of FP6/FP7/H2020 and commissioned directly from industry, chiefly German, were carried out. Unprecedented so far international contacts, involving staff exchange (dozens of people a year, some of whom come to the Centre from abroad), create additional possibilities of research and staff potential development and contribute to a high recognition of the CAMT Research Team's output. As a result, the Marshall of the Lower-Silesian Voivodeship called into being the Lower Silesian Innovation and Science Park (DPIN), managed by the CAMT workers. The DPIN created Technology Innovation Cluster and coordinates its activities (a project form Regional Operational Programme was acquired), it has also prepared many deals with other European clusters. It goes without saying, that the CAMT's status as the Centre of Excellence has changed the approach to all the important aspects of scientific research, commercialization of its results and technology transfer. During our activity, we gained many research, development and industrial projects, working out top scientific research organization methods. We also cooperate with dozens of research centres all over the world and managed to build one of the most modern laboratories in Europe. Our staff consist of young and resilient people (of all the workers, 5 persons are older than 50 years, another 5 have more than 40 years and the rest have around 30 years or less). It is an important aspect of continuous improvement of our engineering staff, which should have an opportunity to master the most recent technologies applied in advanced sectors of not only domestic but also international industry and take up their own scientific activity.

EDIH Name: CeREF
Title: CeREF
Country: Belgium
Description: Founded in Mons on 5 October 1984 and intimately connected with the technical category of the Haute Ecole Louvain en Hainaut (HELHa), the CERISIC’s main object means is to lead or collaborate on studies or applied research projects and offer tailor-made training in the fields of science and technology. CERISIC conducts different kinds of project, which enabled it to generate in 2015 a turnover just above €1 million. CERISIC consists of three research poles: chemistry and biotechnology; electro-mechanical and thermal industries; and, lastly, electronics and electricity. If you wish to develop a new idea, study a new product or improve your company’s competitiveness thanks to a project of applied research, you may also count on the expertise of the electricity and electronics division in the field of design, implementation and testing of numerically controlled controls as well as in the field of test design. Both main research axes concern electrical engineering: developing innovative tools (control and power electronics, intelligent maintenance, active management, etc.) for engine benches of different yields aimed at developing applications in wind turbines, space, industry, etc.) and electronics: developing telecommunication components, optical sensors or personal assistance sensors based on FPGA and Foxboard platforms, a project which embodies the fruit of active cooperation with the HELHa’s paramedical division (standardization of medical knowledge of professional physiotherapists and of the technical competencies of our own team).

EDIH Name: CETMA-DIHSME
Title: CETMA-Digital Innovation Hub for SMEs
Country: Italy
Description: CETMA-DIHSME is the  EDIH promoted and managed by CETMA, a non-profit RTO with 30 years of experience in innovation services to SMEs in Southern Italy. In order to strengthen assistance to SMEs with skills, expertise and tools according to a ‘one stop shop’ logic, CETMA involved 13 other partners in the Hub’s service offering.
Its activities  are strongly focused on the local socio-economic reality (Puglia and Basilicata) where the partners are strongly rooted.
CETMA-DIHSME vision is  that AI, HPC and CS technologies can bring significant benefits to the development of the Territory, but this requires that anything local actors are involved such as PA and SMEs, even the smallest and even those operating in more traditional sectors.
Based on the experience of CETMA and analysis of innovation experts, CETMA-DIHSME starts from the consideration that to foster innovation in small businesses, in addition to "problem solving" services (technology consulting, research, engineering, etc.), it is necessary to support SMEs with "problem setting" services (strategic analysis, business planning, fundraising, supply chain relations, etc.).
For this reason, the EDIH CETMA-DIHSME provides an integrated offering of business and strategy-setting services and technological services.
We offer services for:  awareness building; assistance for strategic setting;  testing and development, such as feasibility studies, simulations, development of artificial intelligence applications, testing and optimization of prototypes;   testing and development in operating environments.
Attention is also dedicated to fundraising support and customised training
CETMA-DIHSME aims to trigger synergies with the relevant opportunities offered by regional, national, and European innovation policies and funding and other innovation operators affecting the same territory. It also wants to exploit the great opportunities of the creation of a structured network of EDIH to promote cohesion between European territories to take advantage of social, economic, and environmental benefits.
