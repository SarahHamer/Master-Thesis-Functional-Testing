EDIH Name: EDIH-CONNECT
Title: A European Digital Innovation Hub for Construction powered by Electronics, Artificial Intelligence & Information and Communication Technologies.
Country: Belgium
Description: In EU-27, the Construction sector represents 25 million workers, 9,6% GDP, 6,4% of total employment and 5,3 million companies for a total of 101,1 b€ turnover. But the sector faces major challenges for the coming years. With 40% of EU energy consumption, 36% of CO2 emissions and only 1% of renovation rate, the sector must massively invest in the green transition keeping in mind that we spend 90% of our time indoor and 97% of the housing stock is (energy) inefficient. The digitalisation of the sector provides a tremendous lever arm to increase the productivity and respond to this green transition but companies lack information, confidence, skills and access to finance to invest in digital. Studies indicate that digital transformation in the Construction sector can result in productivity gains of 14 to 15 percent and cost reductions of 4 to 6 percent. To respond to economic imperatives and increase the digital maturity of its companies, the construction sector has pulled out all the stops to commit itself to the innovation dynamic driven by Digital Europe and proposes the creation of a European Digital Innovation Hub (EDIH) dedicated to Digital Construction (“CONNECT”) in Wallonia. The project will be based on four pillars (test before invest, skills and competences, innovation eco-system and financial support) and articulated around AI, IoT, robotics and more generally data-driven technologies applied in Construction. As the EC recognised the Construction as a priority industrial ecosystem, the EDIH CONNECT will deeply contribute to this strategy and will specifically tackle the low adoption rate of digital by SMEs and the public administration in Wallonia and in the Construction sector in general. It will also enable Walloon companies to export their know-how within a European dimension, while promoting the digital transformation of a sector that is important for the Walloon economy (13% of added value, 17% of total private employment).

EDIH Name: EDIH-GE
Title: EDIH Grand Est - Accelerate digitalisation of manufacturing sector in Grand Est
Country: France
Description: Fostering the digitalization of SMEs and Midcaps is a major objective of regional policies of Region Grand Est (S3, Regional scheme for economic development, innovation, and internationalization,), which is the third most industrialized French region. To do so, the regional authorities have defined a transformation pathway for companies and set up a digital cluster (GET Digital), managed by Grand E-Nov+, the regional innovation and attractiveness agency, that brings together the key public and private stakeholders. Furthermore, the GE territory hosts national and European renowned technology platforms regarding IA, cybersecurity, HPC, and immersive technologies. Nevertheless, these digital infrastructures and expertise have not sufficiently benefited regional companies, due to the poor connections and weak organized links between digital platforms and SMEs from key sectors. The objective of the EDIH GE is to create a one-stop-shop hub to foster the digitalization of industrial SMEs and midcaps (automotive, engineering, mechanics, textile,...), that require support regarding identification, testing, and integration (training, funding) of advanced technologies such as AI or cybersecurity, and HPC in industrial processes. With a budget of 3.8 ME, EDIH GE will deliver services (170 TBI, 500 Trainees, 16 networking events (320 participants), and 80 funding services) in three years to at least 300 companies. To deliver this strategy, GEN+ will coordinate a consortium of 11 partners that gathers 7 Universities and Engineering schools, two TTOs that manage 19 platforms and provides advanced training services, and the regional chamber of commerce that will be active to detect and qualify use cases in SMEs and mid-caps. The EDIH GE partners will be plugged into the DTA, with EEN (GEN+ and CCI GE are members) and with French and European EDIH all along its 770km of borders. EDIH GE will be co-funded by Region Grand Est (40%) and private resources (10%).

EDIH Name: EDOcobot
Title: EDIH Odense for deployment of collaborative robots (cobots) in many domains especially manufacturing and logistics
Country: Denmark
Description: Aim: The purpose of EDOcobot is to improve robot skills and increase the deployment of useful collaborative robots (cobots) in SMEs and small mid-caps and thereby support production in Denmark and Europe, supporting DIGITAL objectives. Method: We categorised end users according to their robot experience and general digital skills and have designed a set of services that cover the whole continuum. As experienced companies are already aware of many options and opportunities, our services focus particularly on beginner SMEs. Beginners are introduced to the variety of cobot systems and led to discover which would work best for them, how their factory needs to be reorganised for the cobot, and how this investment can be funded. “Robot-ready” SMEs are encouraged to deploy more cobots, also in other types of application, and to train more of their staff to operate and program cobots. “Innovator” SMEs are taught how to optimize the way they use cobots and are introduced to tech suppliers, while “Front-runners” are matched with tech developers (and perhaps research calls) so that their end-user challenge can contribute to the future direction of the tech. Expected results: All our customers develop a deeper understanding of cobots and how to use them to best advantage, increasing their hands-on digital skills. They also gain better knowledge of funding opportunities and interact with the wider robot ecosystem. More cobots are deployed in various industrial sectors, including those where robot penetration is traditionally low. Mitigation of the shortage of skilled labour, reduction in workplace injuries, more reliable product quality, less waste. Relevance to the call: Increasing the robot awareness and skills of “beginners” will have great impact on the overall digital skills of European SMEs. Improving European productivity will reduce our reliance on foreign supply chains. Cobots are an accelerating market, so the EDIH network needs a node with a pure cobot focus.

EDIH Name: Global Alliance for Media Innovation (GAMI)
Title: Global Alliance for Media Innovation (GAMI)
Country: France
Description: Global Alliance for Media Innovation is the network for innovation within the World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers (WAN-IFRA). WAN-IFRA’s members are located in over 120 countries and have a combined reach of more than 18,000 publications, 15,000 online sites and 3,000 companies. Following the launch of the Global Alliance for Media Innovation during WAN-IFRA’s World Congress in June 2014, we have established a brain trust of stakeholders involved in research and innovation for news media. The core of this group is composed of pioneers, media organisations (publishers and suppliers), and academic research labs dealing with technology transfer and research programmes in Europe (Norway, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, UK), the Americas (Brazil, USA, Canada), and Southeast Asia (Singapore, Japan). The Alliance was formed because its members all believe that our industry requires a reliable flood of new technologies, products and business models. We see the future of news media being invented right now, all around the globe, by hundreds of different companies, universities and entrepreneurs. But their separate efforts, research, prototypes and rollouts receive inconsistent attention and analysis. Many good ideas fail simply due to a lack of development support, while others get hyped beyond their real value. Vital lessons and examples are not being widely enough or rapidly enough disseminated. GAMI focuses on five main topic areas relevant to the future of news media companies, news professionals, and news consumers: New platforms/distribution channels: mobility, wear-ability, the Internet of Things (smart cities, connected homes, connected cars, connected devices); New forms of narrative and storytelling: immersive content, VR, 360° video, social media; Data exploration: big data, data visualisation, automatic generation of content; Technology enablers: privacy, security; Multiple media convergence: interoperability, standards (IPTC, etc.) GAMI is guided by an Advisory Board representing news media or media labs, suppliers, research centres, universities, technology clusters and accelerators.

EDIH Name: HD-MOTION
Title: Hub for the Digital MObility TransformatION
Country: Italy
Description: In recent years there have been countless advances in connected and cooperative systems for transport and mobility, which are however outlining a paradox: together with the developments underway, challenging and articulated technological needs are emerging, so much so as to make the goal of sustainable, efficient and safe mobility more and more complex to achieve. Indeed, the availability of the technologies necessary for an interoperable implementation of large-scale solutions is only the beginning of a long journey, which cannot ignore economic, market and competitiveness considerations for the involved industries, SMEs and public administrations. The resolution of this paradox is the main objective of the HD-MOTION Hub (HUB for the Digital Mobility Transformation): the ambition to make a great technological leap forward, giving a rapid acceleration to the development of enabling technological solutions, targeting them on innovation and the digitization of sustainable mobility and transport services. SMEs (especially those involved in technology transfer) will be among the end users of the Hub, together with the Public Administration, its services (for example, Public Transport) and citizens. Through the virtuous collaboration of academia, industry and the entire innovation ecosystem, the result of a growth in the competitive capabilities of companies on the Italian territory will be achieved, bridging the technological deficits of innovation and digitization that today penalize them on the European market and world. Through the creation of networks of companies and innovation hubs in the sectors of vehicle production, digital infrastructures and Digital Transportation Systems, basic training and the development of new skills will be implemented, facilitating entry and relocation on the market of the work. At the same time, and in a virtuous circular manner, significant impacts will be generated on the environment and on the users of mobility services.

Description: The Heritage SmartLab (HSL) proposal is aimed at creating the largest, most structured and qualified European Digital Innovation Hub -based in Basilicata region, with two spokes in Campania and Apulia-, specialised on Cultural Heritage and Cultural and Creative Industries (CH&CCIs), a wide sector of the local economy and society -that is, not by chance, at the core of the three Regional Smart Specialisation Strategies- in which converge great public interest and high innovation and business potential. The EDIH initiative, that is strongly supported by Basilicata Region, through its local development agency Sviluppo Basilicata, and by the Municipality of Matera, that participates in this proposal as associated partner, is aimed at creating a Cultural and Creative district based in the wonderful context of the UNESCO World Heritage Site - Sassi of Matera, with a strong international dimension and approach to the market needs of its public and private customers. The proposal leverages on two important initiatives promoted in Basilicata region: the House of Emerging Technology (HET), the main technological infrastructure the City of Matera has made available to the project for designing, prototyping and testing of new products, and the Talent’s Academy promoted by Basilicata Region, based on the Apple Academy of Naples model: an advanced and multidisciplinary training platform, that thanks to the synergies with HSL, will be further specialised on the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI), High Performing Computing (HPC) and Cybersecurity (CS) to CH&CCIs, with the goal to attract talents, upskill and reskill personnel, create a new generation of professional with strong and up–to–date digital competences. The Hub of Matera, with the 2 spokes in Naples and Bari, will represent an innovation triangle in the sector of CH&CCIs, rooted in Southern Italy, active in the European and Mediterranean context and strongly interconnected with the global innovation ecosystem.

EDIH Name: i4CAMHUB
Title: Innovation for Competitiveness and Advance Manufacturing
Country: Spain
Description: i4CAMHUB has been an EDIH since 2017, is a part of DIHNET, has signed agreements with other EDIH to provide services together, and yet there is still place to grow and become more of a reference in the region, in its main fields of work which are the sectors of agrifood and metal manufacturing, and AI as technology (in a second level, also cybersecurity, HPC, AR/VR, human-machine interaction and others).
To do this, this project is focused on developing and establishing relevant activities-services, mainly for SMEs, scaleups, startups, entrepreneurs, but also for the general population.
The first set of activities include three work packages: 2, 4 and 5, focused respectively on: 
- TEST BEFORE INVEST solutions that allow entities or entrepreneurs to investigate how relevant technological solutions would fit their current lines of work or new lines they want to develop without having to make the investment beforehand;S
- Facilitating FUNDING FOR DIGITALIZATION or to TO START-UP BUSINESSES OR LINES OF WORK; 
- NETWORKING SOLUTION, facilitating spaces from where to work or events to get to know possible partners interested in applying the solutions developed by users, in getting together to develop new ones or who can provide them with technology they are needing.
The second one (WP3) is focused on training: 
- Different COURSES, WEBINARS, INFO-DAYS and WORKSHOPS will be offered to diverse target groups including active population, students, unemployed people and people in risk of social exclusion with the intention of improving their chances to get relevant employments and improve their general situation.
The fact that Castilla La Mancha includes large areas of rural space scarcely populated is taken into account and I4CAMHUB intends to facilitate access to these resources also in those areas. I4CAMHUB also has a relevant intent to actively engage with other EDIHs to maximise its reach and improve the general position of Castilla La Mancha in the general European scope.
