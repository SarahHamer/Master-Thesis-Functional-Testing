EDIH Name: AEDIH
Title: Agricultural EDIH
Country: Hungary
Description: AEDIH is the Agricultural European Digital Innovation Hub for Hungary. The 4 project partners will increase the digital capabilities of agricultural enterprises and their confidence in digital technologies through digitalisation services. The AEDIH project accompanies agricultural enterprises through the different stages of the customer lifecycle, providing them complementary services that build on each other in a modular system. This pathway starts with the digital scoping where the digital maturity level of the agricultural enterprises is assessed according to an adapted ADMA (Agricultural Digital Maturity Assessment) methodology. This is followed by the preparation of an individual digital development roadmaps, tailored to the organisation. The roadmap is developed in close collaboration with the respective enterprise and includes recommendations for digital upgrades, including specific service proposals of AEDIH. The next step strives for enhancing the digital readiness of the agricultural enterprises and supports the roll-out of digital upgrades by providing training, demonstration opportunities, testbeds and tests before investment as well as concrete investment planning. Fostering digital upscaling is the third level of implementation, this is where the actual digitisation development takes place, the agricultural enterprise is integrated into the agro-digital ecosystem and AEDIH also supports them in identifying funding sources for their digital progress. AEDIH sees agricultural enterprises as its primary, but not exclusive, target group and intends to involve agricultural advisors and businesses providing innovation and digitalisation products and services, who are not necessarily agro-specific, but agro-interested. The foreseen approach explicitly reflects the low digital maturity of the primary target group and will guarantee the improvement in the proficiency level of digital literacy of the Hungarian small and medium sized agricultural enterprises.

Description: Andalucía Agrotech DIH was established in 2016 under the impulse and leadership of the Regional Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, Fisheries and Sustainable Development. Since its inception Agrotech has worked actively in the field of European cooperation, to transfer to the regional agri-food sector the best practices identified in territories that are leaders in the field of digitalisation. In this sense, Agrotech has become a European reference in the cooperation and promotion of the digital transformation of the agricultural sector. In recent years, Agrotech has led numerous initiatives related to the digital transformation of the agri-food sector. Among the most recent initiatives is the HIBA project, an ambitious initiative that stimulates the consolidation of an Iberian ecosystem that boosts business initiative, competitiveness and sustainability in the agri-food sector. Thanks to the excellent capabilities of the consortium members, Agrotech will make available to agri-food companies digital technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, High Performance Computing and cybersecurity. Services based on these technologies, together with other key digital technologies, will form the basis of the portfolio of services to be offered by Agrotech. Although the users of Agrotech will be mainly Andalusian companies, the impact of the activities to promote digital transformation goes beyond this region. The internationalisation of Agrotech's activity will be supported by a wide network of collaborations that have been built up over the years, as evidenced in the MoUs provided. Agrotech's ambition is to provide direct digital transformation support to a total of 273 agri-food companies. Training and innovation ecosystem strengthening activities will multiply the impact of Agrotech's activities. In economic terms, the activities promoted by Agrotech will trigger investments worth €2.52 million.

EDIH Name: Andalucía Agrotech Digital Innovation Hub
Title: Andalucía Agrotech Digital Innovation Hub
Country: Spain
Description: The Digital Innovation Hub (DIH) Andalucía Agrotech is an ecosystem created to help companies in the digitisation process of the agri-food sector. This hub gathers the needs of the agri-food sector, technological services provided by ICT companies, the innovation capacity of knowledge agents and public programmes promoted by the public administration to provide support. The DIH Andalucía Agrotech has been designed to be an instrument to speed-up the implementation of digitization in the agri-food value chain and to provide, in the first phase, the necessary training.

The DIH Andalucía Agrotech is a centre of activity to create, anticipate and channel digital innovation in the agri-food sector, that provides the best conditions to enable sector companies achieve business success in the long-term. It is:
  • an ecosystem. The Hub has to be understood as a connector and facilitator of all the actors involved in agro-technology. It is the place where the experience and know-how of farmers, livestock producers or agro-industrial experts converge with the innovative talent of technological entrepreneurs, all together with the support of the public sector, as well as with partners and stakeholders of technological and agri-food areas.
  • a one-stop shop. The Hub has to act as a pool of people, resources and tools (financing, talent, processes, methodologies, knowledge, employment, alliances, etc.), that is to say, it has to be the contact point for all the companies, people and actors related to the agri-food sector and to the implementation of digital technologies in this sector.
  • based on Competence Centres. They offer technological infrastructures, provide access to the latest knowledge, experiences and technologies to support their customers with pilot, test or experimental projects using digital innovations.
  • a provider of financial or business support to implement innovations.
  • a platform. It will be a physical and digital platform that will enable the effective collaboration between the actors of the Hub and will make resources available to them according to the working models established.
  • the first regional contact point. Proximity is key to strengthen the innovation ecosystem.
  • a regional and international benchmark hub in the field of agro-technology. Bearing in mind the global environment currently existing, the DIH has to have a double scope: on the one hand, it must be centred on the digitization of the agri-food businesses of Andalusia and, on the other hand, it must work to connect them to other businesses at national and European levels; it must promote the cooperation of actors at regional level, but it must also be a point to generate alliances between our regional initiatives and others beyond our regional borders.
  • a driver of change. Boosting the digitisation of the agri-food sector is a fundamental task, but not an end in itself. It is a powerful way to not only achieve the competitive improvement of the sector but also to obtain positive social and environmental impacts.

Country: Germany
Description: A joint initiative between Stadtwerke Wolfsburg AG and WOBCOM, the iHub aims to turn the region into a preferred investment iHub for technology companies, while also reaffirming North Germany as a premier ICT location. In close collaboration with relevant technology partners, the initiative seeks to secure a set of key enablers to nurture an attractive Open Source ecosystem for targeted investments, for instance, talent, infrastructure, R&D institutions and platforms, incentives and funding, networks, broadband access and liveability.
Non-profit aim
The non-profit aim of our DIH is to strengthen digital innovations in Lower Saxony and to master regional-specific challenges. The vision is to create incentives for new companies to settle in the region and modernize existing ones. The resulting networking of open source and various forms of cooperation should result in solutions that should improve the living conditions of citizens in cities in the long term. For example, this is how practical digital applications are created.
Supporting local SMEs
In close cooperation with national and international technology companies, Stadtwerke and WOBCOM want to create the conditions to promote an attractive open source ecosystem for targeted investments. The aim of the ASTRID iHUB is to make the region a preferred investment location for technology companies and to strengthen northern Germany as a first-class location for information and communication technology (ICT). The open source culture is the basis of all activities of the ASTRID iHUB, where sharing ideas and results creates better solutions and more innovations for everyone. As an open platform, the ASTRID iHUB is intended to promote new ideas for digital services in the future and form a central point of contact for established SMEs in order to jointly identify partners and financing options for projects. The focus is the development and implementation of concepts in the areas of digitization so that cities become more digital (Smart City), mobility more intelligent (Smart Mobility), industry more networked (Smart Industry) and applications more secure (Smart Security). As part of the international open source community of the FIWARE Foundation, the ASTRID iHUB will promote cross-border innovation activities while building bridges to local SMEs.
Our Story
In 2016, the City of Wolfsburg unanimously approved and developed a strategic plan to guide the City’s economic development activities and investment over the next decade. The result was a set of goals, strategies, and actions that will propel the City of Wolfsburg forward toward its vision for 2025. Called #WolfsburgDigital, a Private Public “model city for digitization and electromobility”.
This project had the goals to improve Digital Transformation in the city, the investor in leaders and teams, created for entrepreneurs with the aim of retaining the talent generated in Wolfsburg, which has the collaboration of the University of Ostfalia, Business Partner and the City of Wolfsburg.In 2018, the Stadtwerke Wolfsburg AG built a functionalist construction situated in the heart of the city’s downtown district. The facility’s location, onsite transportation access, and proximity to the airport (Berlin or Hanover) are attractive to commuters from across the metro area (Metropol Region).The newspace has the capacity as a modern office with an integrated Data Center and the objective of establishing a business incubator is to accelerate business growth and success and decrease the likelihood of failure. This in turn creates new jobs, diversifies the industrial base, and enhances the quality of life in the community.
After this experience and a lot of projects in the city, the Stadtwerke Wolfsburg AG, have decided to invest more in Innovation and R&I (Research and Innovation).
The project ASTRID iHUB will be a business incubator based on talent and new technology.

Country: Poland
Description: Research areas and competencies of CAMT are within the most recent development, manufacturing and informatics systems trends known not only in Poland. A broad extent of carried out research programmes and implementation projects assures a constant technological improvement and enhances the scientific and research potential of CAMT – over the centre's existence (since 2000) it has grown from 16 to 76 employees (2 full professors, 3 associate professors, 28 assistant professors, 23 postgraduates and 23 scientific-research workers, paid of commissions and projects). This trend is highly conducive to establishing a close cooperation with industry and enables to carry out research projects in national and international associations – several projects within the frame of FP6/FP7/H2020 and commissioned directly from industry, chiefly German, were carried out. Unprecedented so far international contacts, involving staff exchange (dozens of people a year, some of whom come to the Centre from abroad), create additional possibilities of research and staff potential development and contribute to a high recognition of the CAMT Research Team's output. As a result, the Marshall of the Lower-Silesian Voivodeship called into being the Lower Silesian Innovation and Science Park (DPIN), managed by the CAMT workers. The DPIN created Technology Innovation Cluster and coordinates its activities (a project form Regional Operational Programme was acquired), it has also prepared many deals with other European clusters. It goes without saying, that the CAMT's status as the Centre of Excellence has changed the approach to all the important aspects of scientific research, commercialization of its results and technology transfer. During our activity, we gained many research, development and industrial projects, working out top scientific research organization methods. We also cooperate with dozens of research centres all over the world and managed to build one of the most modern laboratories in Europe. Our staff consist of young and resilient people (of all the workers, 5 persons are older than 50 years, another 5 have more than 40 years and the rest have around 30 years or less). It is an important aspect of continuous improvement of our engineering staff, which should have an opportunity to master the most recent technologies applied in advanced sectors of not only domestic but also international industry and take up their own scientific activity.

CITAH institutionalizes a focal point, firstly for regional transfer between cutting-edge research and practice, secondly for cross-industry adaptation, through which “hidden champions” from different sectors benefit from active knowledge exchange, and thirdly for leveraging the potential of cross-border services through digitalization. CITAH positions itself as a centre for the regional innovation ecosystem by providing services in four fields: • Integration of prototypes and products into the innovation laboratories for agriculture and health, both for testing under almost real conditions and for demonstration to potential (cross-domain) customers. • Training and knowledge transfer on technological competencies (artificial intelligence, interoperability, cybersecurity) and their domain-specific implementations and regulations, • Advisory in financing digitization activities, • Networking of stakeholders from the two addressed industrial domains with information technology companies to form strategic alliances and ecosystems. CITAH builds upon the successful work of the Centre for Digital Innovation in Lower Saxony (ZDIN), founded in 2019 by the state of Lower Saxony, Germany, to institutionalize the process of digital transformation). Through its partnerships, CITAH addresses around 600 companies in the direct regional business environment as well as a multiple in the indirect environment through nationwide multipliers such as Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Chamber of Crafts, German Electrical and Electronic Manufacturers' Association and Federal Office of Consumer Protection and Food Safety.

EDIH Name: CYBER4All STAR
Title: CYBERsecurity 4 All STAkeholdeRs
Country: Bulgaria
Description: Engaging Bulgarian (and European) SMEs, mid-caps and public sector organizations (PSOs) in wide-scale digital transformation has been a challenging endeavor over the past decade. Costs reduction, operations efficiency optimization, and citizens’ empowerment triggered deployment of diverse ICT technologies across the Union, however at disparate speed and penetration levels, and often in a fragmented mode.
Imminent cybersecurity threats ranging from lower level impact attacks, e.g. script kiddies, malware, etc. to highly sophisticated operations launched by cyber terrorists or state-sponsored actors are major challenges, which seem to be equally ambiguously addressed across the Union, leaving some stakeholders significantly more vulnerable than others. Ca. 60% of Dutch and German SMEs maintain log files for analysis after security incidents,while only 16-20% of Romanian and Bulgarian SMEs find it important to analyze those. Likewise, a cybersecurity breach landmark event of occurred in 2019 when the Bulgarian National Revenues Agency database was hacked, and personal data of more than 70% of all Bulgarian nationals was released online. 
To bridge the cybersecurity divide in Bulgaria and the EU, the Digital Innovation Hub "Trakia" was formed as an association in the South-Central Region of Bulgaria in 2021, and the "CYBER4AllSTAR" EDIH project was launched in early 2023, offering cybersecurity expertise, access to experimentation facilities and services, access to finance, and ecosystem networking with disruptive technology suppliers in line with the EDIH Trakia service proposition.
The Hub, coordinated by the oldest business union in Bulgaria (UPEE, member of ECSO), in collaboration with other Cybersecurity EDIHs across Europe (via the European Corridor of Cybersecurity EDIHs, initiated in 2022 by ECSO), is intended to offer a full range of cybersecurity services to all stakeholders with a special focus on SMEs, mid-caps and PSOs. Additionally, AI and HPC services are foreseen to be channeled to end users using the EDIH Network DTA-assisted capabilities. 
The ultimate goal is to make it easy, cost-efficient and technologically-friendly to learn about and to adopt cybersecurity solutions, powered by HPC and AI (among other technologies) on a mass and integrated scale.
