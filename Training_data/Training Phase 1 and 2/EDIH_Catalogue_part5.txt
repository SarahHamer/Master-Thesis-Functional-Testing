EDIH Name: Sirris Hub - Additive Manufacturing Integrated Factory
Title: Sirris Hub - Additive Manufacturing Integrated Factory
Country: Belgium
Description: Additive manufacturing (AM) – or commonly referred to as 3D printing – of metallic mechanical components has become a reality. No longer is 3D printing restricted to the domain of plastics and prototyping. Production of fully functional mechanical components is state-of-the-art. However, additive technology does not yet reach the level of precision (dimensional accuracy, surface finish, etc.) required of such components. Post processing steps, like precision milling operations, are necessary but offer great challenges since printed components often have irregular free-form shapes and thus are not easy to set references, clamp, automate, handle, etc. The DIH addresses the need of the local industry for practical and advanced knowledge on how to integrate the state-of-the-art additive manufacturing, post machining technology, quality control and flexible automation. The DIH is based on the continuous development and exploration of an application lab. The lab will become fully operational in November 2017 and will contain a 3D metal powder bed printer, a five axis precision milling machine, 2 coordinate measuring machines, a femto second laser texturing machine and smart automation solutions. The services of the DIH are: • Industrial feasibility studies • Research projects for industry • Sensibilisation and inspiration for new technologies • Training, Master Classes • Making the bridge between new technologies and industry

Country: Belgium
Description: The industrial tissue of the Brussels-Capital Region (BCR) consists of 99.7% of SMEs and has a high concentration of digital and service-oriented companies. Digital technology is the major driver of their innovations. Nevertheless, these companies perform slightly below the European average on the uptake of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and finish third last in using ICT for environmental sustainability. This specific context justifies the launch of a European Digital Innovation Hub (EDIH) in Brussels. It will act as single point of access for companies to sustainable digital innovation, enabled by AI and other emerging technologies. Based on the local industrial needs and in line with the policies of the Brussels-Capital Region, the following strategic objectives have been defined for the EDIH: - Encourage and facilitate digital innovation for economic, social and environmental transition - Contribute to the post-Covid recovery - Strengthen Brussels’ leadership in artificial intelligence - Be a gateway to Europe, promoting and enriching Brussels’ expertise and industry - Facilitate digitization of the Brussels’ industry This proposal brings together all necessary elements to implement a successful EDIH in Brussels: - A thematic focus that translates into a balanced and flexible service portfolio to support the regional SMEs to improve their (future) competitiveness. - A strong support from the Brussels-Capital Region that aspires to be frontrunner in Belgium and Europe. It will co-finance the EDIH for 50% during the next 7 years with an amount of 2.1M€ for the first 3 years. - A lean and experienced consortium that can deliver the services in 3 different languages (French, Dutch & English) and set up European corridors and reach out to other EDIHs. The EDIH will be implemented by 5 complementary innovation actors in Brussels being Agoria, Sirris, BeCentral, ULB and VUB. It will reach 1500 companies.

EDIH Name: Sweden Secure Tech Hub by Sweden ICT
Title: Sweden ICT – a constellation of six of Sweden’s leading Science Parks, have joined forces to accelerate impact towards a green and sustainable future by using new technology on a broader scale
Country: Sweden
Description: Sweden ICT is a non-profit consortium with Sweden’s 6 leading ICT-focused science parks. The proposed EDIH project will further strengthen Sweden ICT as the go-to hub/ecosystem for achieving significant capability-building and progression in secure digital transformation. Secure digitalization is critical. The increasing rate, magnitude and cost of malicious cyber-attacks in recent years have become the biggest threat to sustaining the forthcoming digital transformation, in the private and public sector. Paradoxically, Sweden is ranked very high in digitalization and has significant expertise in cyber security on a national level – but there is in the private and public sector a significant lack of up-take and deployment of secure digital processes, technologies and solutions. For the national efforts to have an impact, there needs to be orchestrated, effective, and large-scale work on the local/regional level to raise awareness, build capacity, and support tangible progression towards secure digital transformation. And this is exactly what the Sweden ICT EDIH project is designed to provide. Established in 2019, Sweden ICT covers the whole of Sweden and includes clusters of more than 2400 member companies with more than 60,000 employees. In addition, via partners, Sweden ICTs reach increases to approx 50 000 SMEs. This wide reach is also reflected in the project KPI:s – e.g more than 13000 SMEs and public organizations will benefit from at least one of the 17 distinct services offered by Sweden ICT EDIH. Thus, Sweden ICT EDIH delivers secure digital transformation on a larger scale and at a faster pace. With a project set-up containing identical regional customer journey support processes executed at 6 regions, and coordinating work-packages across these processes, the project achieves significant economies of scale – e.g by aggregating a large number of needs analyses, developing joint communication efforts and delivering a joint portfolio of services.

EDIH Name: VNG NL DIGI HUB
Title: Dutch Societal Innovation Hub
Country: Netherlands
Description: The Dutch Societal Innovation Hub is the hub for strengthening interregional cooperation for a mission-driven approach in the public sector in times of data and digital technology. Together we are working on responsible, people-centered solutions for the societal challenges around climate-neutral cities and regions, healthy soil and biodiversity, and climate adaptation.  
Systemic change for societal challenges 
Major social challenges require innovative policy. Challenges such as circularity and housing are so complex that existing organizational silos must be broken down to create the best solutions for society. In the coming years, the public sector faces the task of redefining its way of working and its role in the ecosystem. We see the emergence of data and digital technology as one of the elements that offer opportunities to involve citizens, businesses and social players in the policy process and implementation and to make policy more adaptive, for example through monitoring climate goals or predicting spatial puzzles with digital twins. This is only effective when not only the technology and data are in order, but also people start working together in a new way. Societal innovation is crucial. 
A mission-driven approach 
The Dutch Societal Innovation Hub stimulates cooperation between regions in the Netherlands and in the EU focussed on a mission-driven approach in the public sector in times of data and digital technology. Each municipality and province is working on digital innovation projects. We support in bringing successful projects in the public sector to the next level and to create a common ground for innovation across regions. We focus on new ways of working and societal innovation. The hub focuses on three pillars: 
1. RETHINK: A mission-driven approach and strategy for digital innovation. 
2. RESHAPE: A shared innovation infrastructure for the public sector 
3. RECONNECT: Knowledge sharing and collaboration 
Collaboration in the ecosystem 
The Dutch Societal Innovation Hub is set up with 2 umbrella organizations IPO and VNG representing all local and regional public actors. DSIH consists, in addition to the national constituency of municipalities and provinces, of five regional public-private ecosystems:    
- Data and Knowledge Hub Healthy Urban Living  
- Digicampus  
- Municipality of Rotterdam  
- Urban Development Initiative   
- Brightlands Public Services Lab  
Each partner is committed to improve sustainable, healthy and safe living in cities and regions. These ecosystems offer building blocks in the form of development locations (living labs), where the public sector can experiment together with industry and knowledge institutions. The DSIH is part of a wider European network of hubs.

Description: Lying at the heart of Europe, Wallonia (the French-speaking region of Belgium) economic history is closely linked to the role of industry, with a strong industrial past in machinery manufacturing and metallurgy. Today, manufacturing is still the driving force behind Wallonia's exports and prosperity. Nevertheless, the foundations of the manufacturing industry need to be considerably strengthened in order to increase technological excellence as well as to facilitate the green and digital transition of the region. WalHub, the regional EDIH, will boost the Walloon manufacturing business helping them to tackle challenges linked to customer expectations by accelerating or enhancing their digital maturity, through experimentation of key technologies (e.g. AI, HPC, CS and IoT), training and upskilling workers to meet the market needs, attracting investments, linking them to the Walloon ecosystem to ease implementation of digital technologies in their production processes and supply chain. Finally, WalHub will connect with the network of EDIHs by offering its services to SMEs from other regions across Europe and will actively engage with other EDIHs to respond promptly to the digital needs of Walloon manufacturing businesses. To support Walloon manufacturing business to achieve greater competitiveness and sustainability at regional level, WalHub, brings together a consortium of complementary and experienced partners that will provide a comprehensive set of services aiming at accelerating the green and digital transformation of industrial and supply chain processes. WalHub is led by the industry and technology federation (Agoria) and involve 2 clusters active in Manufacturing and Transport and Logistics (MecaTech and Logistics in Wallonia), 4 research and competence centers (Sirris, Cenaero, Cetic, Multitel) and an economic development partner (IDELUX). In this project, WalHub also benefits from the support of the Walloon Digital Agency (Agence du Numérique).
