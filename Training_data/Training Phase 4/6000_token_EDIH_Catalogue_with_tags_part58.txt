EDIH Name: Technology Transfer via Multinational Application Experiments (TETRAMAX)
Title: Technology Transfer via Multinational Application Experiments (TETRAMAX)
Country: Germany
Description: Started in 2013, the initiative TETRACOM (https://www.tetracom.eu) was designed as a pilot project with a novel and unique vehicle to boost small-scale and highly focused bilateral academia-industry technology transfer in all ICT domains. During its three-year pilot phase, it has strongly demonstrated how to optimally address the gap to bring academic excellence to sound business results. With a special focus on small and medium-sized enterprises, the pilot financially supported 50 actual transfer experiments throughout Europe and helped to generate a multitude of new jobs, new products and new businesses. Based on its highly recognized success TETRACOM has evolved into TETRAMAX, operating at much larger scale and with even higher ambitions (https://www.tetramax.eu). It is primary aiming to provide the implementation of the European “Smart Anything Everywhere (SAE)” initiative in the domain of customized low energy computing (CLEC) for CPS and the IoT. The initiative builds on three major activity lines: (1) Stimulating, organizing, co-funding, and evaluating different types of cross-border Application Experiments, providing “EU added value” via innovative CLEC technologies to first-time users and broad markets in European ICT-related industries, (2) Building and leveraging a new European CLEC competence center network, offering technology brokerage, one-stop shop assistance and CLEC training to SMEs and mid-caps, and with a clear evolution path towards new regional digital innovation hubs where needed, and (3) Paving the way towards self-sustainability based on pragmatic and customized long-term business plans. The project impact will be measured based on well-defined, goal-oriented performance indicators. The immediate ambition of TETRAMAX within its duration is to support 50+ industry clients and 3rd parties in the entire EU with innovative technologies, leading to an estimated revenue increase of 25 Mio. € based on 50+ new or improved CLEC-based products, 10+ entirely new businesses/SMEs initiated, as well as 30+ new permanent jobs and significant cost and energy savings in product manufacturing. Moreover, in the long term, TETRAMAX will be the trailblazer towards a reinforced, profitable, and sustainable ecosystem infrastructure, providing CLEC competence, services (https://www.tetramax.eu/the-project/​) and a continuous innovation stream at European scale, yet with strong regional presence as preferred by SMEs.

EDIH Name: Tuscany X.0
Title: Tuscany EU Digital Innovation Hub
Country: Italy
Description: Tuscany X.0 (TX0) is a federation of all the main Tuscany players of research and technology transfer. It is composed of 3 System integrators, 3 Access points and 13 Providers. While the Research and Technology Transfer ecosystem is rich of highly qualified institutions at top levels in research and advanced applications, the industrial environment in the region is fragmented and composed of a myriad of SMEs, too often the last sacrificial elements of long international supply chains. TX0 aims at becoming a No-Profit System Integrator able to coordinate the technology transfer ecosystem to support the sustainable growth of the regional economy, in parallel with the enhancement of its public entities, and to concur with the other EDIHs to Europe technological independence. Tuscany needs a system integrator with a clear aim to show applied results before asking the entrepreneurs’ and PA managers’ commitment and investments. TX0 does not focus on technology transfer of R&D ideas and technologies with low TRL, but, instead, promotes the adoption of advanced technologies through their intelligent customization to the real industrial needs, requirements and constraints. We strongly believe that AI, CS and HPC have to be considered as a bundle and a powerful toolbox for enhancing the digital maturity level of the industry and PA in Manufacturing, Healthcare, Tourism,etc.TX0 management system is driven by the EDIH call’s goals, declined into specific project objectives, measured by key results, that are obtained through activities, monitored by specific KPIs with pre-defined targets to achieve (in terms of provided services). Such management system will be implemented in a Customer Relationship Management software that will be used to track the project and to transfer the funds to partners according to the real targets they achieved. This meritocratic and evidence-based approach promotes the effectiveness of activities, their quality and lets best practices to emerge.
