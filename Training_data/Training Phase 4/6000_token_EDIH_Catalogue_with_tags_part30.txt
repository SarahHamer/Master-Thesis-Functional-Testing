EDIH Name: eDIH-DIZ
Title: DIGITAL INNOVATION ZONE EDIH - MANUFACTURING & SMART HEALTH for better business, life and health in the North East Romania region
Country: Romania
Description: eDIH-DIZ is a 9 partners consortium covering North-East Romania and aims to support successful and sustainable digital and green transformation of the region by strengthening the capacities of the only fully-operational DIH Digital Innovation Zone in the region. Since Romania in general, and the North-East region in particular, ranks 27th out of 27 member states in the EU DESI profile for the past years, and the region's competitivity is on the last place in Romania and one of the worst 10 performers in the EU, the successful functioning of an EDIH will directly impact the Digital Europe programme strategic objectives to support achievement of EU digital targets. A complete set of EDIH services will be provided in order to: - support local SMEs (mainly from manufacturing & healtchare) and public healthcare institutions increase their digital maturity through targeted programs, - offer them access to relevant test before invest and experimentation facilities for Artificial Intelligence and other key enabling technologies, and their use cases in healthcare and manufacturing, - help them develop internal capabilities (employee upskilling) that will lead to successful digital transformation, while guiding them to overcome access to finance barriers, - connect the region with the EDIH EU network, by developing corridors for missing regional expertise, - create synergies for the region with the EIT Health network, other EIT KICs, Enterprise Europe Network, prestigious research & innovation organizations in the field of AI, - continuously grow the community by integrating relevant stakeholders, for the benefit of the region and of the target group. Consortium strength (academia, technology transfer, research, policy maker entities, target group representatives and digital private actors) will lead to EDIH target achievement for 2021-2023 and set the right ground for further developing hub outreach, sustainability and regional impact beyond the project end.

EDIH Name: EDIH-EBE
Title: European Digital Innovation Hub - Energy in the Built Environment
Country: Belgium
Description: The EDIH-EBE focus is on sectoral coverage on Energy in Buildings and Districts, and as such, positions itself with focus and specialism for digitalisation within sector-coupling between Construction, Energy and ICT.
Its main objective is to act as a central access point, a “One-stop-shop” in providing range of services with the ultimate goal to support SMEs and public sector organisations towards successful digital transformation.
The ‘hub’ is based on the strong mobilisation of the excellent competences/expertise and infrastructure/facilities already available in Flanders.
Customers are supported with knowledge and expertise in (forward looking) digital technologies, trainings to increase competences in skilled work force, networking/info sessions/matchmaking events for improving awareness and bringing together actors of supply and demand in digital solutions, access investments for cost of equipment and software, and testing and experimenting environment to experience benefits leading to higher productivity, better technical performance, new business models and services.
Given the EDIH-EBE specialization, the support offered and the target market segments’ economic activity, it has a high potential for direct impact on the goals of the European Green Deal in terms of positive environmental effects and contribution to the reduction of carbon emissions, efficient use of resources, higher productivity and improved technical performance and business cases.
Specific objectives are to:▪ Have a specific focus & sectoral coverage on Energy in Buildings and Districts, at level ofindividual buildings, interaction of energy flows between buildings, and interaction with the energy grid. As such, it positions itself with focus and specialism for digitalisation within sector-coupling between Construction, Energy and ICT.
▪ Provide support for several Digital Technologies: Artificial Intelligence (AI), High PerformanceComputing (HPC), Cybersecurity, Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud computing, Building Information Management (BIM), Big Data, Datasets, Data analytics, Simulation/Software, Digital Twin. The overarching motivation is stimulating use of these technologies, withinbusiness/functions to improve products, processes, productivity and services.
▪ Position itself as facilitator for uptake of advanced digital technologies and theiraccelerated use in the construction industry. Embracing digital technologies in the energydomain in the built environment is essential for energy efficient construction and renovation ofbuildings/districts, with increased digitalization in the built environment being seen as muchnecessary step (e.g. ‘Renovation Wave’). Many Flemish companies (and elsewhere in Europe)are lagging in digital skills and are in need of knowledge, skills and experience to increase theirdigital maturity level, making the urgency very high of providing them with necessary support.
▪ Establish fully operational ‘One-Stop-Shop’ in the Region of Flanders (Belgium)incorporating all necessary functionalities for smooth functioning of the EDIH Services.The hub is based on strong mobilisation of the excellent competences/expertise andinfrastructure/facilities already available in Flanders. It is also based on strong mechanisms for networking and matchmaking within its innovation ecosystem as well as collaboration of EDIH-EBE across Europe, namely through benefiting from networking and collaboration within the EU-EDIH- Network and relevant competences and capacities built up in the context of the Digital Europe Programme.

EDIH Name: EDIH-GE
Title: EDIH Grand Est - Accelerate digitalisation of manufacturing sector in Grand Est
Country: France
Description: Fostering the digitalization of SMEs and Midcaps is a major objective of regional policies of Region Grand Est (S3, Regional scheme for economic development, innovation, and internationalization,), which is the third most industrialized French region. To do so, the regional authorities have defined a transformation pathway for companies and set up a digital cluster (GET Digital), managed by Grand E-Nov+, the regional innovation and attractiveness agency, that brings together the key public and private stakeholders. Furthermore, the GE territory hosts national and European renowned technology platforms regarding IA, cybersecurity, HPC, and immersive technologies. Nevertheless, these digital infrastructures and expertise have not sufficiently benefited regional companies, due to the poor connections and weak organized links between digital platforms and SMEs from key sectors. The objective of the EDIH GE is to create a one-stop-shop hub to foster the digitalization of industrial SMEs and midcaps (automotive, engineering, mechanics, textile,...), that require support regarding identification, testing, and integration (training, funding) of advanced technologies such as AI or cybersecurity, and HPC in industrial processes. With a budget of 3.8 ME, EDIH GE will deliver services (170 TBI, 500 Trainees, 16 networking events (320 participants), and 80 funding services) in three years to at least 300 companies. To deliver this strategy, GEN+ will coordinate a consortium of 11 partners that gathers 7 Universities and Engineering schools, two TTOs that manage 19 platforms and provides advanced training services, and the regional chamber of commerce that will be active to detect and qualify use cases in SMEs and mid-caps. The EDIH GE partners will be plugged into the DTA, with EEN (GEN+ and CCI GE are members) and with French and European EDIH all along its 770km of borders. EDIH GE will be co-funded by Region Grand Est (40%) and private resources (10%).
