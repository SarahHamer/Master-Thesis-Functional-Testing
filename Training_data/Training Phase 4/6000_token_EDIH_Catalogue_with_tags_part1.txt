EDIH Name: ADi4SMEs
Title: Accelerated Digitalisation of SMEs in the North Central Region through creation and development of an European Digital Innovation Hub
Country: Bulgaria
Description: The European way for the Digital decade is to create a network of European digital innovation hubs to support the European SMEs and administration in the regions to accelerate their digital transformation. In the context of the Digital Europe Programme, this project represents creation and development of an EDIH to offer services to the SMEs and administration in the North Central Region of Bulgaria to reach higher digital maturity level and strengthen the resilience of the regional industry by boosting its digitalisation. The services are planned to be of twin type: both digital and green. The Hub activities and services are focused on Artificial intelligence in the typical smart specialisation of the region Mechatronics and Informatics and ICT, but target also the most valuable capital – skilling, re- and up-skilling of the human resources. The lack of knowledge in the Hub to support the SMEs in the vast digitalisation field will be mitigated and overcome via the access to the broad network of EDIHs.

EDIH Name: AEDIH
Title: Agricultural EDIH
Country: Hungary
Description: AEDIH is the Agricultural European Digital Innovation Hub for Hungary. The 4 project partners will increase the digital capabilities of agricultural enterprises and their confidence in digital technologies through digitalisation services. The AEDIH project accompanies agricultural enterprises through the different stages of the customer lifecycle, providing them complementary services that build on each other in a modular system. This pathway starts with the digital scoping where the digital maturity level of the agricultural enterprises is assessed according to an adapted ADMA (Agricultural Digital Maturity Assessment) methodology. This is followed by the preparation of an individual digital development roadmaps, tailored to the organisation. The roadmap is developed in close collaboration with the respective enterprise and includes recommendations for digital upgrades, including specific service proposals of AEDIH. The next step strives for enhancing the digital readiness of the agricultural enterprises and supports the roll-out of digital upgrades by providing training, demonstration opportunities, testbeds and tests before investment as well as concrete investment planning. Fostering digital upscaling is the third level of implementation, this is where the actual digitisation development takes place, the agricultural enterprise is integrated into the agro-digital ecosystem and AEDIH also supports them in identifying funding sources for their digital progress. AEDIH sees agricultural enterprises as its primary, but not exclusive, target group and intends to involve agricultural advisors and businesses providing innovation and digitalisation products and services, who are not necessarily agro-specific, but agro-interested. The foreseen approach explicitly reflects the low digital maturity of the primary target group and will guarantee the improvement in the proficiency level of digital literacy of the Hungarian small and medium sized agricultural enterprises.
