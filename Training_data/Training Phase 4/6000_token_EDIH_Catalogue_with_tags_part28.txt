EDIH Name: EDIH Suedwest
Title: European Digital Innovation Hub Suedwest
Country: Germany
Description: In recent years innovation in products and services is to an increasing extent based on digitalisation which enables enhanced or new functionalities. A key question is “How to optimise the transformation of this potential?” Especially SMEs need an easy access to technologies and capabilities enabling the digital transformation. Here EDIH Südwest helps by pooling different offers in a one-stop-shop, concentrating on the region but also sharing services across borders. EDIH Südwest focuses on three prevailing industrial sectors in South-West Germany: automotive, health and manufacturing. A technological focus is set on “smart sensor systems powered by edge AI”, offering a variety of application opportunities in all three sectors. Another focus is on resilience. These foci will be assessed and adapted, if necessary, throughout the project lifetime. To maximise impact, the services in the four action fields, “training & skills”, “test before invest”, “support to find investments” and “innovation ecosystem”, are specifically tailored towards three distinct groups of clients, “founders, start-ups and spin-offs”, “SMEs, small midcaps and the public sector” and “individuals”, the latter including pupils, students, employees and executives. EDIH Südwest has set up two orthogonal corridors for collaboration with other EDIHs. One in the field of a specific set of hard- and software technologies (Smart Systems) while the other one addresses the automotive area. 13 partners build a strong consortium, ensuring a well-balanced coverage, both geographically as well as across technologies and services. This core consortium is accompanied by further 11 parties who are also very active in the region. The EDIH Suedwest tightens collaboration by bringing partners closer together to catalyse digitalisation in the region and at the same time trigger exchange and cooperation with other European regions.

EDIH Name: EDIH Suedwestfalen
Title: European Digital Innovation Hub for employee-centered digital transformation in South Westphalia
Country: Germany
Description: The planned EDIH is located in the German region of South Westphalia. South Westphalia is an industrial region with a strong focus on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), with more than 150 so-called “hidden champions”, i.e. those often little-known small and medium-sized enterprises that are among the European and world market leaders in niche markets. The major industrial sectors of metal production and processing as well as mechanical engineering generate 75 % of total sales in the industrial sector each year, accounting for about two-thirds of total industrial employment. South Westphalia is therefore not only the third strongest region in Germany and by far the strongest industrial region in North Rhine-Westphalia (most populous federal state in Germany), but also one of the oldest industrial regions in Europe. However, the strategic orientation of EU policies and the twin objectives of making Europe greener and more digital poses challenges for the rather traditional “old industry” within South Westphalia. The focus must therefore be on providing the best possible support for SMEs within South Westphalia in overcoming these challenges. For this reason, establishing an EDIH with a strong European orientation is of particular benefit to the South Westphalian economy with its high export quota. The economic success of SMEs in South Westphalia is based on the expertise of their employees, which has grown over decades. The EDIH SWF will provide a set of services and infrastructures to support SMEs in how this product-specific expertise of human specialists and executives can be complemented by the adoption and development of in-depth, socio-informatic digitization competencies in the design of human-centered artificial intelligence, employee-based cyber-security as well as socio-technical assistance systems. The EDIH will support SMEs during the transformation process in cooperation with the social partners to maintain innovative strength in the long term.
