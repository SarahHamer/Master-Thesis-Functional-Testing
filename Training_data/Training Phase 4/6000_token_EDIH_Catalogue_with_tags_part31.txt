EDIH Name: EDIH-SH
Title: European Digital Innovation Hub Schleswig-Holstein
Country: Germany
Description: The European Digital Innovation Hub Schleswig-Holstein (EDIH.SH) aims to increase sustainability by creating new or novel digital solutions at process and product level using digital innovation. Economic, ecological and social aspects must be taken into account to be able to systematically evaluate those possible gains and implement them. Digital innovations will be created here through the interaction of a wide range of players from business, government and other relevant stakeholders. Key areas of focus are artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance computing (HPC), cybersecurity, Internet of Things (IoT), sensor technology, interoperability and deeper digitalisation. The co-creation based approach is an interactive and reflexive process in which a range of possibilities in those key areas are explored and translated into concrete innovation projects. The EDIH.SH will accompany the process from the generation of innovation potentials and ideas, examination of those ideas for economic and technical feasibility, to the creation of technical implementation concepts and the first prototypical implementation. The EDIH.SH offers funding and financing possibilities and individual consulting as the implementation of innovative ideas in new products, processes and services requires a high financial effort. With its free services, the EDIH.SH focuses on small and medium-sized enterprises as well as public administration organisations from the maritime and life science sectors, which are particularly significant for Schleswig-Holstein.  The digital platforms established as part of the EDIH.SH ensure the efficient collaboration of all stakeholders in joint R&D activities, idea generation and projects. The focus is always on enabling or shaping the successful transfer of expert knowledge into real value creation. A consortium of universities and the IB.SH will pool their expertise and resources to drive innovation in Schleswig-Holstein.

EDIH Name: EDOcobot
Title: EDIH Odense for deployment of collaborative robots (cobots) in many domains especially manufacturing and logistics
Country: Denmark
Description: Aim: The purpose of EDOcobot is to improve robot skills and increase the deployment of useful collaborative robots (cobots) in SMEs and small mid-caps and thereby support production in Denmark and Europe, supporting DIGITAL objectives. Method: We categorised end users according to their robot experience and general digital skills and have designed a set of services that cover the whole continuum. As experienced companies are already aware of many options and opportunities, our services focus particularly on beginner SMEs. Beginners are introduced to the variety of cobot systems and led to discover which would work best for them, how their factory needs to be reorganised for the cobot, and how this investment can be funded. “Robot-ready” SMEs are encouraged to deploy more cobots, also in other types of application, and to train more of their staff to operate and program cobots. “Innovator” SMEs are taught how to optimize the way they use cobots and are introduced to tech suppliers, while “Front-runners” are matched with tech developers (and perhaps research calls) so that their end-user challenge can contribute to the future direction of the tech. Expected results: All our customers develop a deeper understanding of cobots and how to use them to best advantage, increasing their hands-on digital skills. They also gain better knowledge of funding opportunities and interact with the wider robot ecosystem. More cobots are deployed in various industrial sectors, including those where robot penetration is traditionally low. Mitigation of the shortage of skilled labour, reduction in workplace injuries, more reliable product quality, less waste. Relevance to the call: Increasing the robot awareness and skills of “beginners” will have great impact on the overall digital skills of European SMEs. Improving European productivity will reduce our reliance on foreign supply chains. Cobots are an accelerating market, so the EDIH network needs a node with a pure cobot focus.
