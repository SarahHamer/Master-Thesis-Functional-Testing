NOTE:
The 'Type' field indicates whether the EDIH has received a 'Seal of Excellence', is an EDIH, or a DIH.
- 'EDIH' means the hub is part of the funded European Digital Innovation Hub network. It is co-funded by the European Commission and Member States/Associated Countries.
- 'Seal of Excellence' means the hub was evaluated positively in a European competitive call but is funded exclusively by national or regional resources.
- 'DIH' means digital innovation hubs with similar activities to EDIHs but not connected to the network.

EDIH Name: CITAH
Title: Cross-Industry Transformation in Agriculture and Health
Country: Germany
Description: The proposed EDIH “Cross-Industry Transformation in Agriculture and Health” (CITAH) implements the idea of regionally effective lead industries and activates agri-food and health as innovation domains in Northwest Germany (NUTS-2 region DE94, Weser-Ems) that drive the cross-industry development of innovative technologies as well as their adaptation and diffusion. CITAH institutionalizes a focal point, firstly for regional transfer between cutting-edge research and practice, secondly for cross-industry adaptation, through which “hidden champions” from different sectors benefit from active knowledge exchange, and thirdly for leveraging the potential of cross-border services through digitalization. CITAH positions itself as a centre for the regional innovation ecosystem by providing services in four fields: • Integration of prototypes and products into the innovation laboratories for agriculture and health, both for testing under almost real conditions and for demonstration to potential (cross-domain) customers. • Training and knowledge transfer on technological competencies (artificial intelligence, interoperability, cybersecurity) and their domain-specific implementations and regulations, • Advisory in financing digitization activities, • Networking of stakeholders from the two addressed industrial domains with information technology companies to form strategic alliances and ecosystems. CITAH builds upon the successful work of the Centre for Digital Innovation in Lower Saxony (ZDIN), founded in 2019 by the state of Lower Saxony, Germany, to institutionalize the process of digital transformation). Through its partnerships, CITAH addresses around 600 companies in the direct regional business environment as well as a multiple in the indirect environment through nationwide multipliers such as Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Chamber of Crafts, German Electrical and Electronic Manufacturers' Association and Federal Office of Consumer Protection and Food Safety.

EDIH Name: CLOTEX-HUB
Title: EDIH Clothing Technology and Textile Hub
Country: Ukraine
Description: European Digital Innovation Hub of Clothing Technology and Textile (CLOTEX-HUB) aims to increase the competitiveness of garment manufacturing products of small and medium-sized enterprises of the Khmelnytskyi region of Ukraine due to the digitisation of clothing manufacturing and the introduction of innovative technologies to ensure the product’s entry into the European market, thus integrating into international chains of creating added value of products and services.
CLOTEX-HUB operates within the ecosystem of a sewing cluster factory, providing high-added-value services for experimentation, access to training, technological infrastructures and financial support through a dynamic and interconnected ecosystem, firmly committed to becoming a relevant player in the EDIH network, expanding its collaboration outreach to other European regions. Khmelnytskyi ranks in the top ten in clothing manufacturing in Ukraine, representing over 1000 registered SMEs. The “Development Strategy of Khmelnytskyi Region for 2021-2027” states that the region's smart specialisations are defined as follows: food industry, light industry, mechanical engineering, and metalworking. In the field of light industry in the Khmelnytsky region, where CLOTEX-HUB operates, a smart specialisation is textile and clothing production. On the other hand, innovation capacity and digitalization intensity are still ranked rather low at the European level.
EDIH CLOTEX-HUB will contribute to increasing the efficiency level in the sewing industry and machine-building sectors of digital transformation, giving priority to (i) clothing business entities operating in the Khmelnytskyi region of Ukraine and (ii) the implementation of main digital technologies (Advanced Digital Skills, VR/AR technologies, Artificial Intelligent, and Cybersecurity).
The consortium consists of four Beneficiaries (Khmelnytskyi National University; NGO Agency for Sustainable Development “ASTAR”; PU “Podillia Fashion Cluster”; NGO “IT CLUSTER OF KHMELNYTSKYI”).
