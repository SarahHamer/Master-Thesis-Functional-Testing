EDIH Name: AGORA DIH
Title: Murcia Region DIH
Country: Spain
Description: Murcia region industrial sector and, particularly, SMEs are aware of the high need of digital transformation to maintain their competitiveness and adapt to an increasingly dynamic and global ecosystem. However, the low awareness about digital technologies, an insufficient innovation culture and the need for substantial investment represent a burden for Murcia region companies, which are micro-SMEs in a vast majority. In this sense, Agora EDIH is born in 2020 from the scaffold of a previous Digital Innovation Hub, the Innovation for Manufacturing in the South (I4MSOUTH) created in 2016, and a querying process within the main innovation actors in Murcia Region. Agora EDIH is composed of 6 institutions, namely 2 universities, 2 Innovation and Enterprise European Centres, a Technology Centre and the Regional Development Agency of Murcia, which are the critical players to develop the key enabling technologies of Agora EDIH, Cybersecurity and AI, for digital transformation in Industry 4.0 within the different sectors highlighted on the Specialization Strategy of the Region (RIS3Mur). Particularly, Agora EDIH will focus on Agrofood, quality of life, driving activities and energy and sea and marine affairs. Agora EDIH will operate to support SMEs in every step of the process of acquiring new technologies needed to implement digital transformation. Besides these self-managed actions, Agora EDIH will build longstanding collaborative projects with other EDIHs to create a symbiotic environment by sharing resources, experiences and know-how and extend the services offered to their SMEs. The vision of this EDIH is that facilitating digital transformation of companies in RIS3Mur prioritized sectors and activities, will contribute to productivity, new businesses models and exacerbate industrial competitiveness of Murcia region.

EDIH Name: Agrihub Sweden
Title: Smart Agtech Sweden EDIH
Country: Sweden
Description: The agrifood system that many of us take for granted is under pressure. Climate change is causing challenges for crop production due to floods and droughts, monotonous arable landscapes decrease biological diversity, zoonosis diseases are spreading in animal production, and food fraud and ransomware is hampering the food processing industry. On top of that, the sector faces problems to attract skilled workers, due to bad working conditions. Swedish food production is a core sector of the economy with potential to become an innovative growth engine of the 20th century. To succeed, knowledge investments, knowledge transfer and digital applications are needed to improve production effectiveness and the attractiveness of the sector. Digitalisation is central to achieve Sweden's high ambitions regarding environment and climate goals as well as food strategy. Agrihub Sweden is a powerful initiative that brings together well established and renowned organisations around a common vision: to transform the Swedish agrifood system into a world class example in achieving sustainability and competitiveness through digitalisation. Agrihub Sweden is coordinated by RISE and Testbed for digitalized agriculture and based on collaboration with Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences and other regional platforms in Eastern-Central Sweden (Agtech 2030 and Visual Sweden c/o Linköping University), Western Sweden (SmartAgri c/o Agroväst), and Southern Sweden (c/o Krinova). Agrihub Sweden aims to become the most attractive EDIH in Europe for SMEs and public authorities operating in the agrifood sector. Through agrifood field environments for real-world data collection and testing, expertise within IoT, AI and cybersecurity, as well as locations and competence for knowledge building and networking, Agrihub Sweden provides an excellent environment for a green and digital transformation of the agrifood value chain.

EDIH Name: AgrotechDIH
Title: Andalucía Agrotech Digital Innovation Hub
Country: Spain
Description: Andalucía Agrotech DIH was established in 2016 under the impulse and leadership of the Regional Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, Fisheries and Sustainable Development. Since its inception Agrotech has worked actively in the field of European cooperation, to transfer to the regional agri-food sector the best practices identified in territories that are leaders in the field of digitalisation. In this sense, Agrotech has become a European reference in the cooperation and promotion of the digital transformation of the agricultural sector. In recent years, Agrotech has led numerous initiatives related to the digital transformation of the agri-food sector. Among the most recent initiatives is the HIBA project, an ambitious initiative that stimulates the consolidation of an Iberian ecosystem that boosts business initiative, competitiveness and sustainability in the agri-food sector. Thanks to the excellent capabilities of the consortium members, Agrotech will make available to agri-food companies digital technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, High Performance Computing and cybersecurity. Services based on these technologies, together with other key digital technologies, will form the basis of the portfolio of services to be offered by Agrotech. Although the users of Agrotech will be mainly Andalusian companies, the impact of the activities to promote digital transformation goes beyond this region. The internationalisation of Agrotech's activity will be supported by a wide network of collaborations that have been built up over the years, as evidenced in the MoUs provided. Agrotech's ambition is to provide direct digital transformation support to a total of 273 agri-food companies. Training and innovation ecosystem strengthening activities will multiply the impact of Agrotech's activities. In economic terms, the activities promoted by Agrotech will trigger investments worth €2.52 million.
