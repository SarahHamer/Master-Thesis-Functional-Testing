EDIH Name: Elbfabrik of the Fraunhofer IFF
Title: Elbfabrik of the Fraunhofer IFF
Country: Germany
Description: The mission of the VDTC is to explore and promote the role of human operators in an ever-increasing digitized and automated production and work environment. Following an approach coined as “Digital Engineering and Operation”, the VDTC postulates the consistent and consequent use of digital data throughout the life cycle of a production and/or work system. Being able to fully retain and exploit data from and within all steps in the life cycle, from design, to testing, documentation, factory planning, training, operation to dismantling, offers the opportunity to radically change human machine interaction. The VDTC offers solutions for embedding human operators in a digitized and automated environment by providing assistance systems, which fully benefit from a virtual knowledge base established through the approach of digital engineering and operation.
Within this mission, the VDTC offers its services to companies of varying sizes from SME and Mid-Caps to large companies and international corporations. The VDTC’s solutions, moreover, provide for different customized approaches addressing companies on different innovation stages, from awareness raising and maturity level identification for newcomers to digitization, to insular solutions and services for starter companies, to full systems solutions for advanced companies.

The Hub is built on core competences acquired in 20+ years of innovation policy of the Emilia-Romagna Region, that brought to the creation of an effective innovation ecosystem, made by many public and private actors who invested - and are still investing - in the delivery and adoption of new technologies and innovation across all economic and social sectors. 
PARTNER
A public partnership and an ecosystem to support the Hub
ER2Digit is the result of a partnership consisting of:

ART-ER, which brings its experience in implementing the innovation practices of the Emilia-Romagna region and in coordinating the local ecosystem and the hub itself.
LEPIDA, the main regional public player that supports the digitalization of the public bodies. It is an operational facility of the Emilia-Romagna Regional Authority for the development of telecommunications infrastructure, enabling services and applications, and a driver of the implementation and dissemination of Digital Agenda topics.
CINECA, a Consortium composed of 115 Italian universities and public institutions, is the largest computing centre in Italy and one of the main ones worldwide. CINECA hosts and manages LEONARDO, the world’s fourth supercomputer, which provides 20% of Europe’s and 80% of Italy’s computational power.

For its activities, ER2Digit also uses the skills and research and experimentation capabilities of the industrial research Laboratories of the Emilia-Romagna High Technology Network.
ER2Digit represents an opportunity for digital innovation and for the development of society and the data economy. It is one of the first results of the regional strategy for the creation of the Emilia-Romagna Data Valley.
