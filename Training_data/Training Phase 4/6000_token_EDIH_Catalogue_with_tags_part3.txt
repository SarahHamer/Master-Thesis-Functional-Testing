Title: Artificial Intelligence EDIH Hungary
Country: Hungary
Description: European Digital Innovation Hubs (EDIH) aim to fulfil an active role in enhancing, fostering, and accelerating digital transformation and twin (green and digital) transitions. AI EDIH Hungary (AIEH) focuses on the key technology area of artificial intelligence supporting the exploitation of its the potential and targeting to increase national and European competitiveness and economic growth and technology sovereignty. The project aims to support the digital transition of companies (SMEs, small mid-caps, start-ups) and public sector organisations to create and implement AI-enabled products, services with special focus on seven priority industries. The activities of AIEH will reflect local stakeholders specific needs. Its operation will cover the whole territory of the country and include cooperation with fellow EDIHs just as with other relevant stakeholders. The AI EDIH project provides extensive, comprehensive end-to-end services to target groups, with other words the customer journey that enables clients to increase and deepen their AI-related general and specialized digital capacities by providing practice-oriented professional support and solutions for customized AI business application and implementation, financing opportunities, and marketisation. The centre of the AI EDIH' s intervention logic is a funnel-shaped comprehensive client journey: building basic interest and consciousness, sharing expertise, and providing support through the development of digital transformational project plans, supporting the realisation of the proof of concept and the construction of a prototype. The impact to be achieved is the increased digital and market maturity of the organisation and enhanced market creation potential. For each of the outcomes and impact, a quantified (numerical) target is defined. The project will be implemented by a consortium of high-ranking professional organisations including recognized key experts with in-depth practical knowledge and experience.
