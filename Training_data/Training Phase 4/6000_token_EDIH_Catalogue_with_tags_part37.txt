EDIH Name: HSL
Title: HERITAGE SMARTLAB
Country: Italy
Description: The Heritage SmartLab (HSL) proposal is aimed at creating the largest, most structured and qualified European Digital Innovation Hub -based in Basilicata region, with two spokes in Campania and Apulia-, specialised on Cultural Heritage and Cultural and Creative Industries (CH&CCIs), a wide sector of the local economy and society -that is, not by chance, at the core of the three Regional Smart Specialisation Strategies- in which converge great public interest and high innovation and business potential. The EDIH initiative, that is strongly supported by Basilicata Region, through its local development agency Sviluppo Basilicata, and by the Municipality of Matera, that participates in this proposal as associated partner, is aimed at creating a Cultural and Creative district based in the wonderful context of the UNESCO World Heritage Site - Sassi of Matera, with a strong international dimension and approach to the market needs of its public and private customers. The proposal leverages on two important initiatives promoted in Basilicata region: the House of Emerging Technology (HET), the main technological infrastructure the City of Matera has made available to the project for designing, prototyping and testing of new products, and the Talent’s Academy promoted by Basilicata Region, based on the Apple Academy of Naples model: an advanced and multidisciplinary training platform, that thanks to the synergies with HSL, will be further specialised on the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI), High Performing Computing (HPC) and Cybersecurity (CS) to CH&CCIs, with the goal to attract talents, upskill and reskill personnel, create a new generation of professional with strong and up–to–date digital competences. The Hub of Matera, with the 2 spokes in Naples and Bari, will represent an innovation triangle in the sector of CH&CCIs, rooted in Southern Italy, active in the European and Mediterranean context and strongly interconnected with the global innovation ecosystem.

Title: i.ku - Innovationsplattform Kufstein / Innovation Hub Kufstein, Tyrol
Country: Austria
Description: The digitalization of (business) processes and digital technologies impact economies and society and, in consequence, our life and work in unprecedented ways. In order to maintain the attractiveness of the business location, the Kufstein chamber of commerce initiated together with the Kufstein University of Applied Sciences the Innovation Hub “i.ku – Innovationsplattform Kufstein“. Partners from the regional economic ecosystem and additional organisations have expressed heightened interest in the project, which is co-financed by LEADER funds.
i.ku - Innovation Hub Kufstein provides formats in a variety of shapes such as meetups for topical discussions between scientific & corporate experts, innovation challenges for students & researchers, dialogues with partners from the regional economy and children’s summer camps. In close collaboration with the Kufstein University of Applied Sciences, i.ku assists with the matching of corporate and academic ideas as a complementary precursor for R&D project proposal development.
i.ku - Innovation Hub Kufstein thus provides numerous offers for different stakeholders in the (supra-)regional educational and organizational landscape with focus on the augmentation of technology awareness and the heightening of the capacity for technology absorption.

EDIH Name: i4CAMHUB
Title: Innovation for Competitiveness and Advance Manufacturing
Country: Spain
Description: i4CAMHUB has been an EDIH since 2017, is a part of DIHNET, has signed agreements with other EDIH to provide services together, and yet there is still place to grow and become more of a reference in the region, in its main fields of work which are the sectors of agrifood and metal manufacturing, and AI as technology (in a second level, also cybersecurity, HPC, AR/VR, human-machine interaction and others).
To do this, this project is focused on developing and establishing relevant activities-services, mainly for SMEs, scaleups, startups, entrepreneurs, but also for the general population.
The first set of activities include three work packages: 2, 4 and 5, focused respectively on: 
- TEST BEFORE INVEST solutions that allow entities or entrepreneurs to investigate how relevant technological solutions would fit their current lines of work or new lines they want to develop without having to make the investment beforehand;S
- Facilitating FUNDING FOR DIGITALIZATION or to TO START-UP BUSINESSES OR LINES OF WORK; 
- NETWORKING SOLUTION, facilitating spaces from where to work or events to get to know possible partners interested in applying the solutions developed by users, in getting together to develop new ones or who can provide them with technology they are needing.
The second one (WP3) is focused on training: 
- Different COURSES, WEBINARS, INFO-DAYS and WORKSHOPS will be offered to diverse target groups including active population, students, unemployed people and people in risk of social exclusion with the intention of improving their chances to get relevant employments and improve their general situation.
The fact that Castilla La Mancha includes large areas of rural space scarcely populated is taken into account and I4CAMHUB intends to facilitate access to these resources also in those areas. I4CAMHUB also has a relevant intent to actively engage with other EDIHs to maximise its reach and improve the general position of Castilla La Mancha in the general European scope.
