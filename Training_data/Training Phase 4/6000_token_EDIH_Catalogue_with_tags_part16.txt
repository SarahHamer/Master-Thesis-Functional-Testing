The proposed services will be free of charge for customers. The services will be offered by DIGIHALL consortium coordinated by CEA/List and composed of six other leading partners in innovation and over ten network partners, not part of the consortium but able to deliver services to industries. The activities of the DIGIHALL project are organized in eight work packages. We pay specific attention to engagement of SMEs and to the analysis of the impact of the services delivered. DIGIHALL will offer its services to the other EDIHs in France and in Europe in particular with the EDIHs from EDIH4MANU network.

OUR VISION
digihub.li is a European Digital Innovation Hub in the legal form of a Liechtenstein Venture Cooperative (LVC), focused on establishing digital ecosystems for cocreation and collaboration in the token economy.We accelerate digital innovation in Liechtenstein by bringing together SMEs and the public sector in co-creation spaces to jointly tap the potential for viable business models across organizations. Communication on equal terms plays an essential role in this.Building on the forward-looking blockchain legislation in Liechtenstein, we have already invested locally in the necessary Web3 technologies and algorithms for meaningful work to provide immediate relevant offerings to SMEs and the public sector. For us, digitalization and sustainability go hand in hand.We strive for the overall goal to maintain and expand wealth and prosperity as well as attractive workplaces in Liechtenstein by leveraging digital and green transformation.
WHAT WE OFFER
DIGITAL ECOSYSTEMS
Establishing purposeful digital ecosystems, based on the needs of SMEs and the public sector in Liechtenstein
Positive digital change enables both quantitative and qualitative growth. In the future, this will be generated primarily through innovation in digital ecosystems. In these, SMEs and the public sector come together to jointly develop thematic solutions for customers. Blockchain technologies are key enablers in this regard, for example in the areas of construction or the Internet of Things (IoT). Step by step, we are bringing SMEs – from solopreneurs to larger manufacturing companies – together with public sector teams in Liechtenstein in our digital collaboration ecosystem to ensure future growth and prosperity for the country. In addition to monthly dialog formats, we are planning larger events such as a Digihub Hack Day and a Digital Innovation Day for the entire country.
SKILLS FOR DIGITAL INNOVATION
Providing the skills for and of SMEs and public sector employees to thrive in digitalization, and to facilitate the knowledge exchange between the EU and Liechtenstein
Our analysis has shown that advanced skills are associated with greater confidence in digital and sustainable transformation. We focus on providing SMEs and public sector teams with access to the best training from the European EDIH network and offer our own training courses focused on meaningful work, communication and blockchain technologies. In addition, we act as a multiplier and disseminate the use of digital competences and resources built under the Digital Europe program.
COACHING FOR POSITIVE TRANSITION
Practical, task-based coaching to enable trusted, impact-driven collaboration on complex challenges, connecting digital, sustainable and personal transformation
We work with leaders and employees to accompany their personal development from «competing against each other» to «co-creating solutions». This shift in the approach to collaboration is a prerequisite for successful work in ecosystems.We invite representatives of SMEs and the public sector in Liechtenstein to participate in our coaching program and open formats such as the «Communication Café», that enable a change of perspective and mind-opening moments in collaboration.
INNOVATION NETWORK
Hosting innovation spaces for start-ups, SMEs and investors to jointly promote and develop viable digital business models
We build and maintain structured long-term relationships with relevant local actors beyond SMEs and the public sector, including impact investors such as foundations, family offices or business angels. Also, we work together with the national authorities, chambers of commerce and industry as well as the banking association and other associations and federations. By matching innovative business models with potential investors, we contribute to the goal of the Liechtenstein government to innovate business models and attract financing for implementation projects.

EDIH Name: DiGiNN
Title: Cyprus DIGital INNovation Hub
Country: Cyprus
Description: DiGiNN will introduce a new level of support toward the digital transformation of Cyprus, as the country needs urgent action to address its digital maturity levels. DiGiNN aspires to become a one-stop-shop for all companies and public sector organisations, providing them an end-to-end experience in their digitisation journey; from coaching and mentoring by reputable experts, access to the most advanced infrastructure and facilities, support to find investments, to networking and access to innovation ecosystems. To achieve this, we gather the local champions in digital technologies, including all relevant Centres of Excellence, and partner them with both National industrial representation bodies and sectoral associations, thus establishing the direct interface between state-of-the-art offer and broad demand. Blending in are the most active incubators, whose mission is to nurture innovative start-ups in the early stages of commercialisation and support them in terms of upskilling, networking and accessing funds for further development. Finally, DiGiNN will orchestrate a number of groups and clusters, introducing representatives of the quintuple helix to ensure that our motto “Leaving no one behind” drives our activities throughout the project and creates the conditions for sustainable digital development of the local ecosystem. Furthermore, DiGiNN takes it one step further than just being an excellent service provider and facilitator; High in our agenda is to develop a “Digital culture” among the National economy actors, by creating the appropriate ecosystem and developing working relations between the country’s economic actors and the experts who can enable the digital transformation of private (SMEs) and the public sectors in Cyprus and Europe. This will not only drive demand, but ensure that the ecosystem continues to operate and develop once the EC and local funding is no longer available at the end of the 3+4 year period.
