NOTE:
The 'Type' field indicates whether the EDIH has received a 'Seal of Excellence', is an EDIH, or a DIH.
- 'EDIH' means the hub is part of the funded European Digital Innovation Hub network. It is co-funded by the European Commission and Member States/Associated Countries.
- 'Seal of Excellence' means the hub was evaluated positively in a European competitive call but is funded exclusively by national or regional resources.
- 'DIH' means digital innovation hubs with similar activities to EDIHs but not connected to the network.

Description: hub4industry (h4i) est.2019 operates in Małopolska Region Kraków (Poland). Focuses on digitalisation of manufacturing SMEs. The Orchestrator, Krakow Technology Park(KPT) is one of the most developed and respected Polish business support organisations. With incubator, accelerator, seed funds, special economic zone, and experience in project management KPT is fit to lead the hub and together with 9 Partn. (+2 Affiliated Partn.) that represent various technology and knowledge areas commits to build not-for -profit DIH that will close the gap of knowledge and experience among SMEs regarding the digitalisation and will introduce and help executing Green Deal goals locally. H4i goal is to offer broad, holistic range of services to become “go to address” for SMEs starting or speeding up digital transformation and sustainable transformation. Technical range starts from DEP priorities: AI, Cybersec, digital skills up to additive manufacturing, smart robotisation, IoT, 5G connectivity. The offer is set up from 19 services i.e. Skills and Training, Test Before Invest, Support in funding areas. They are supported by Communication, Dissemination, Community and Networking actions. Although substantial investments in h4i already have been made in last 3 years, approx. 1,5M euro (public and private) and pilot project was delivered outperforming expectations and KPIs, joining EDIH network by h4i is essential for further development of the hub, increasing the number of services, and building up it’s capacity. Extensive market research was conducted together with regional gov. to design project responding to actual needs and challenges of local SME.

EDIH Name: HD-MOTION
Title: Hub for the Digital MObility TransformatION
Country: Italy
Description: In recent years there have been countless advances in connected and cooperative systems for transport and mobility, which are however outlining a paradox: together with the developments underway, challenging and articulated technological needs are emerging, so much so as to make the goal of sustainable, efficient and safe mobility more and more complex to achieve. Indeed, the availability of the technologies necessary for an interoperable implementation of large-scale solutions is only the beginning of a long journey, which cannot ignore economic, market and competitiveness considerations for the involved industries, SMEs and public administrations. The resolution of this paradox is the main objective of the HD-MOTION Hub (HUB for the Digital Mobility Transformation): the ambition to make a great technological leap forward, giving a rapid acceleration to the development of enabling technological solutions, targeting them on innovation and the digitization of sustainable mobility and transport services. SMEs (especially those involved in technology transfer) will be among the end users of the Hub, together with the Public Administration, its services (for example, Public Transport) and citizens. Through the virtuous collaboration of academia, industry and the entire innovation ecosystem, the result of a growth in the competitive capabilities of companies on the Italian territory will be achieved, bridging the technological deficits of innovation and digitization that today penalize them on the European market and world. Through the creation of networks of companies and innovation hubs in the sectors of vehicle production, digital infrastructures and Digital Transportation Systems, basic training and the development of new skills will be implemented, facilitating entry and relocation on the market of the work. At the same time, and in a virtuous circular manner, significant impacts will be generated on the environment and on the users of mobility services.
