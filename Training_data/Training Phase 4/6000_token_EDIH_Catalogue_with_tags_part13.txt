EDIH Name: CROBOHUBplusplus
Title: CROatian Industry and Society BOosting – European Digital Innovation HUB
Country: Croatia
Description: Europe is at the beginning of biggest transformation in history, and it is all based on understanding that the way we use limited natural resources for maintaining and improving our living standard in Europe and in the world has come to an end. It is crucial to start improving business and society but to do it on more sustainable and innovative way through digital and green transformation. Based on this notion the crucial aspect that we don’t have is time but on the other hand through all data it shows that knowledge, infrastructure, and experience is existing, but it is insufficiently connected, facilitated and focused throughout Europe and this is why we need more networked approach. In that context we see European Digital Innovation Hub (EDIH) CROBOHUB ++ as an ecosystem of excellence that is specialized in three key areas of the Digital European Program (DEP): 1. Artificial intelligence, 2. Cybersecurity, 3. High-performance computing. Our intention is to form the core of a coherent package of services that will support SMEs that intend to harness the digital and green transformation with focus on the following sectors: 1. Manufacturing industry, 2. Digitized agriculture, 3. Energy and environment as well as to help 4. Public administration to become more agile and data driven. EDIH CROBOHUB++ will be a non-for-profit hub acting in the NUTS2 region HR04 "Continental Croatia" with national scope. The support will be provided in the following technologies: Blockchain, Computer vision, Digital simulations, Embedded control and automation systems, IoT, Robotics and Smart sensors. The support will take the form of various types of services as Financial and business consulting, Knowledge and technology transfer, Pre-investment testing: integration and adaptation of technologies, digital testing, demonstration activities, Networking between companies or with users and technology suppliers and training&skills development in different digital&busines competencies.

EDIH Name: CYBER4All STAR
Title: CYBERsecurity 4 All STAkeholdeRs
Country: Bulgaria
Description: Engaging Bulgarian (and European) SMEs, mid-caps and public sector organizations (PSOs) in wide-scale digital transformation has been a challenging endeavor over the past decade. Costs reduction, operations efficiency optimization, and citizens’ empowerment triggered deployment of diverse ICT technologies across the Union, however at disparate speed and penetration levels, and often in a fragmented mode.
Imminent cybersecurity threats ranging from lower level impact attacks, e.g. script kiddies, malware, etc. to highly sophisticated operations launched by cyber terrorists or state-sponsored actors are major challenges, which seem to be equally ambiguously addressed across the Union, leaving some stakeholders significantly more vulnerable than others. Ca. 60% of Dutch and German SMEs maintain log files for analysis after security incidents,while only 16-20% of Romanian and Bulgarian SMEs find it important to analyze those. Likewise, a cybersecurity breach landmark event of occurred in 2019 when the Bulgarian National Revenues Agency database was hacked, and personal data of more than 70% of all Bulgarian nationals was released online. 
To bridge the cybersecurity divide in Bulgaria and the EU, the Digital Innovation Hub "Trakia" was formed as an association in the South-Central Region of Bulgaria in 2021, and the "CYBER4AllSTAR" EDIH project was launched in early 2023, offering cybersecurity expertise, access to experimentation facilities and services, access to finance, and ecosystem networking with disruptive technology suppliers in line with the EDIH Trakia service proposition.
The Hub, coordinated by the oldest business union in Bulgaria (UPEE, member of ECSO), in collaboration with other Cybersecurity EDIHs across Europe (via the European Corridor of Cybersecurity EDIHs, initiated in 2022 by ECSO), is intended to offer a full range of cybersecurity services to all stakeholders with a special focus on SMEs, mid-caps and PSOs. Additionally, AI and HPC services are foreseen to be channeled to end users using the EDIH Network DTA-assisted capabilities. 
The ultimate goal is to make it easy, cost-efficient and technologically-friendly to learn about and to adopt cybersecurity solutions, powered by HPC and AI (among other technologies) on a mass and integrated scale.

EDIH Name: CyberSec
Title: National Center for Secure Digital Transformation
Country: Poland
Description: (CyberSec) National Centre of Secure Digital Transformation is a specialised European Digital Innovation Hub (EDIH) in cybersecurity area. Its main objective is to offer small and medium enterprises (SMEs) as well as state and self-government institutions the whole range of services that allow their secure existence in fully digitalized environment, and (in case of SMEs) implementing their own solutions that are technically mature but also resistant to cyberattacks. The offered services will be available for practically all organization, for which the fact of increasing their technological skills would require to enter the area of public networks together with the Industry 4.0 area (industrial networks) and the inherent threats. Having taken into account the aforementioned statements, the Centre has planned the following basic group of services: - Advisory and consulting services that range a single IT infrastructure (belonging to the service user). The objective is assuring the possibly highest level of protection of the inspected IT infrastructure, such that the organisation operating in digital environment remained resistant against cyber threats - Services assuring that the software created by EDIH customers has high level of resistance to cyber attacks by giving support to embed Secure Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Management and monitoring services and active prevention against unauthorized attempts of accessing the resources (SOC – Security Operations Centre) To carry out the afore mentioned services specialized knowledge in cybersecurity area is essential. The deficit of specialists in this area is notable and according to forecasts it will get deeper. Lower enterprises and public institutions as well as large distributed enterprises face difficulties in gaining and maintaining specialists with relevant skills. (CyberSec) EDIH is designed to directly fill this gap, sharing knowledge and expertise plus embedding them inside the customers' organizations.
