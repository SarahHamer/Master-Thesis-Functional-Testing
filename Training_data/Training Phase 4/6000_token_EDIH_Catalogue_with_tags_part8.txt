EDIH Name: Carpathian EDIH
Title: Carpathian EDIH: pursuing dual transformation (digital & green transition) in the western regions of Ukraine
Country: Ukraine
Description: Carpathian EDIH (EDIH) aspires to spearhead a dual transformation (digital & green) in five regions in the West of Ukraine: Ivano-Frankivsk, Chernivtsi, Zakarpattia, Ternopil and Volyn. Our mission is to increase competitiveness of the local economy to prevent brain drain to the bigger cities of Ukraine and abroad. For that, we will empower for- and non-profit organizations guiding them in the adoption of Advanced Digital Technologies, through Business Support Services, Test-Before-Invest, Skills Development, and Community Building. We’ve designed our services to form a smooth customer journey, from need assessment to profound monitoring & evaluation. Aligned with the region's Smart Specialization, priority sectors include manufacturing (Processing Industries, Light Industries, Construction, Energy) and service industries (Hospitality & Tourism, Creative Industries & Media, Education). Core technological pillars encompass Cybersecurity, AI & Machine Learning, Cloud Computing, Robotics & Cyber-Physical Systems, and Gamification. Moreover, our dedicated focus is on Green Tech & Sustainable Construction, crucial for Ukraine's post-war recovery; as the safer western region of Ukraine now is acting as a test bed for innovative approaches for future reconstruction of the frontline territories. The Hub’s infrastructure will thus include a Sustainable Construction Center with a specialized Green Tech prototyping facility, alongside three other facilities: Robotics, Multimedia Technologies, and a general-purpose prototyping facility. For this ambitious initiative, we have forged partnerships with key stakeholders, including educational institutions, business development agencies, professional organizations, local government, and ICT providers. Together, we aim to unlock the region's innovation potential and effectively integrate into the European network, leveraging technology for collective prosperity.
