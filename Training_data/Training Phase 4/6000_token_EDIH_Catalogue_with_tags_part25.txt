EDIH Name: EDIH Adria
Title: European Digital Innovation Hub Adriatic Croatia
Country: Croatia
Description: Experts who offer knowledge, experience and problem-solving skills

The EDIH Adria consortium includes two scientific research institutions (the University of Rijeka and the University of Pula), global technology leaders in their fields (Ericsson Nikola Tesla and Infobip, the first Croatian unicorn), business support institutions (Step Ri, the leading Croatian Institution for Business Support), and a technological innovation cluster (Rijeka Development Agency Porin - local development agency for entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial incubator system). The project is built on two essential technologies that are in great demand in Croatia: artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing (HPC).
EDIH Adria will assist enterprises in accelerating the integration of modern technology, training their personnel, identifying finance options, and establishing links with key regional, national, and European actors. To further meet these objectives, the EDIH Adria project partners will work together to provide a variety of services to future users.
Support for all aspects of digital transformation

For most businesses, digital transformation requires a shift from a traditional mindset to a collaborative and experimental approach. While these new approaches to business reveal solutions that can improve the customer experience, drive employee innovation, and drive company growth at the grassroots level, they can be too much of a burden for many businesses without adequate professional and financial support.
EDIH Adria's planned operations provide support with different aspects of digital transformation, including digital strategy, processes, technology, digital culture, and human resources. They include an elaborate set of digitization and education services for users, as well as networking, complementing, and cooperating with other EDIHs in the European Union, which encourages the development of an ecosystem in which entrepreneurs, employers' associations, and support institutions, on the one hand, academic and educational sectors, on the other, and the public sector and policymakers, on the third, form the ecosystem with significant financial support.

Ensuring the development of an innovative and resilient business ecosystem in the Adriatic Croatia

In addition to EDIH's advisory services and determining the potential for the digital transformation of business and measuring progress, evaluating potential investments, and identifying changes that will create the greatest benefits for business and competitiveness, future users will be assisted in finding new business opportunities and markets, internationalizing business, and enhancing cooperation through networking and active participation in the innovation ecosystem. Most significantly, prospective customers of EDIH Adria consortium specialists' services will be able to test and deploy digital technologies in their businesses, as well as attend practical and applicable training suited to individual needs.
