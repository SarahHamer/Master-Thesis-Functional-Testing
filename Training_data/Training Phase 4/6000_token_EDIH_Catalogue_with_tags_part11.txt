Title: Centre of Innovation for Data Tech and Artificial Intelligence
Country: Spain
Description: The Government of Catalonia approved in February 2020 the Catalonia.AI Artificial Intelligence Strategy, a strategic country plan focused on artificial intelligence (AI) aligned with the goals of the European Commission in this area. This strategy, as outlined in the document of the same name, deploys a program of specific actions to strengthen the AI ecosystem in Catalonia and lead in generating knowledge, social and business application, and the creation of AI-based solutions that promote economic growth and improve the quality of life for citizens. The objectives associated with the implementation of the strategy are as follows: • Ecosystem: Promote a cross-cutting governance model to support the development of a coordinated and connected AI ecosystem with the world. • Research and Innovation: Boost research and innovation through the application of specific instruments and the establishment of synergies between the administration, specialized research and innovation centers, and organizations heavily involved in AI. • Talent: Create, attract, and retain specialized talent to drive the development of AI solutions and the transfer of knowledge to society, while also enabling citizens and professionals from other sectors to address its impact. • Infrastructure and Data: Have the necessary infrastructure for AI development and facilitate secure access to public and private data. • Adoption of AI: Encourage the incorporation of AI as an innovation driver in the administration and in strategic sectors such as agri-food, health and well-being, the environment, mobility, tourism, culture, and industry, among others. • Ethics and Society: Promote the development of ethical AI that respects current legality, is compatible with our social and cultural norms, and focuses on people. The CIDAI, the Center for Data and Artificial Intelligence Innovation, is the component of the Catalonia.AI strategy responsible for implementing activities related to innovation, the technological ecosystem, and knowledge dissemination to foster the adoption of AI and data technologies globally (in business, administration, society). CIDAI is an association composed of public administration bodies, companies, and technological centers that came into effect on February 24, 2020, through the signing of the collaboration agreement document, which establishes that Eurecat is responsible for its operational coordination. The Steering Committee is the highest governing body of CIDAI (Center for Data and Artificial Intelligence). This Committee is composed of all the Promoter Partners, each represented by the individual they designate for this purpose. At the time of its establishment, the CIDAI Steering Committee will consist of the founding Promoter Partners who signed the agreement for the establishment of CIDAI, which are: • Government of Catalonia • Barcelona City Council • Eurecat Foundation • Barcelona Super Computing Centre – National Supercomputing Center • Computer Vision Center Consortium • NTT Data • I2CAT Foundation, Internet and Digital Innovation in Catalonia • Microsoft Ibérica, S.R.L., • SDG Consulting España, • HUAWEI • SAP • IDEAI – UPC (La Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya - BarcelonaTech (UPC)) The presidency of the Steering Committee falls to the representative of the Government of Catalonia, as established in the agreement for the establishment of CIDAI.
