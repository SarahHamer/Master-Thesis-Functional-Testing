EDIH Name: AIR4S
Title: Digital Innovation Hub in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics for Sustainable Development Goals
Country: Spain
Description: AIR4S DIH, located in the Region of Madrid, aims at facilitating the access to a multidisciplinary service catalogue able to boost the digital transformation of strategic regional industries and the modernisation of the public administration based on the uptake of AI, Data-driven & Robotics technologies. The project aims at upgrading the activity of AIR4S by implementing its support model specifically designed for facilitating the delivery of AIR4S support services. At the same time, the project looks for increasing the engagement of new regional stakeholders and resources to AIR4S and scaling its support at EU level by developing crossregional collaborations within the Network of European Digital Innovation Hubs, in order to export/import services to/from other EU regions. AIR4S project is strongly encompassed by two main principles: 1.Defense of a sustainable digitalisation of the industry contributing to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), by seeking a compromise between the social, legal, and ethical codes around AI & Robotics and, the sustainable growth of businesses, in a way that their investment is returned into societal benefits. 2.Contribution to the development of the Data Economy underpinned by the EU Strategy for Data and the DIGITAL Programme. AIR4S has been recognized with the BDVA/DAIRO iSpace Gold Label as the leading data space in the region, which facilitates the access to data testing facilities and connections to EU data spaces and data ecosystems. The project workplan relies on the delivery of 4 types of services: 1) access to AI, Data & Robotics infraestructures and technical expertise for developing test before invest pilots; 2) training and mentoring activities for the improvement of technical and business skills around AI & Robotics; 3) assessment on public and private funding opportunities and, 4) support actions for building relationships within the local and EU innovation ecosystems around the data economy.

EDIH Name: AIR4S - Artificial Intelligence & Robotics for Sustainable Development Goals
Title: AIR4S - Artificial Intelligence & Robotics for Sustainable Development Goals
Country: Spain
Description: Artificial Intelligence & Robotics for Sustainable Development Goals (AIR4S) is the one-stop-shop hub in Madrid Region that provides innovative solutions and services to Industry and Public Administrations on Artificial Intelligence and Robotics based technologies. AIR4S bets for the accomplishment of Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) as a way to leverage growth on organizations in a sustainable way and to effectively return to the society their investment.
The DIH seeks to promote the development and growth of industry in the Community of Madrid through the use and implementation of technologies based on artificial intelligence and robotics as a driver of change and transformation of industrial and business activity in line with the objectives of recent initiatives promoted by the regional and national government. Its activity is non-profit, as it aims to facilitate the digitisation process of the business fabric of the Community of Madrid (more than 90% of which is made up of SMEs and Startups) and of the Public Administration. All the project's resources are invested in achieving these objectives aimed at social and economic change and transformation.
AIR4S is promoted and coordinated by UPM, and it counts with the participation of outstanding partners strongly committed to complete an amazing open innovation ecosystem to drive companies to transform, grow and become more competitive in the digital world.
AIRS4S will help entities, specially SMEs but also midcaps, big companies and public administrations, to improve their products, services and processes, by introducing the great advantages of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics into their business. UPM firmly believes that the future of innovation in these technologies is to address the co-creation of the digital future together with other disciplines in research, open innovation and education, aligning business and growth with the Sustainable Development Goals.
AIR4S vision is to become a reference DIH in Europe contributing to the digitization of industry by transforming companies and public administration through Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals and being respectful with the social, legal and ethical aspects of these technologies.
To achieve this vision AIR4S internally operates in a network of 5 Research Institutes, 13 Research Centers, 3 Innovation Centers and 200 research groups where professors, researchers, engineers, students, business developers and entrepreneurs, physically come together to jointly co-create the digital future in all areas of Engineering and Architecture.

AIR4S ecosystem
Thanks to this UPM broad environment, AIR4S can provide all-disciplines-companies a multidisciplinary and personalised approach and consequently address multisector domains in a confident way, bringing together world-class technological expertise and infrastructure on AI & Robotics but also deep knowledge on how to apply these technologies on different market domains. The expertise and collaborations of the different sectoral Centers/Schools definitively contributes to support organizations in their related field, tackling their digitization process really from the market need (eg: Agronomics School, Forestry School, Biomedical Technology Center, Mines and Energy School, etc.).
UPM is a leader in AI & Robotics technologies, with a number of H2020, National and Regional Research and Innovation projects, but also with long-term direct alliances with companies which fully acknowledges UPM track record expertise in these technologies. UPM is Founding Member of the Big Data Value Association (BDVA) and Member of the euRobotics Association, and is actively contributing to the European Artificial Intelligence Alliance and the EuroHPC Joint Undertaking.
The DIH is complemented by leading stakeholders that will successfully complement AIR4S services and impact thanks to its huge expertise proving services to entities, supporting different funding models and disseminating innovation in the region.
AIR4S is supported by many funding sources, but specifically by the Madrid Region innovation hubs call with 450K€ for the 3-year period 2019-2020.

EDIH Name: AIR-Andalusia
Title: ANDALUSIAN DIGITAL INNOVATION HUB IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND ROBOTICS
Country: Spain
Description: The main objective of AIR-Andalusia is to set up and guarantee the correct operativity of a regional node for the European Digital Innovation Hubs in Andalusia (Spain). Located in the south of the Iberian Peninsula, Andalusia is the most populated Autonomous Community and the second largest in Spain; being an outermost region of Europe. AIR-Andalusia is conceived as a supporting tool to foster the digital transformation of the region, focused on applied Artificial Intelligence and Robotics for (a) SMEs and small mid-caps and (b) public sector organisation, as varied a sectoral coverage as possible. AIRA aims to improve entities’ efficiency and competitiveness, providing them with access to different digitalization services focused on improving business processes, products or services. The services list includes different offers of support covering the whole life cycle of the new product/service development, either to solve technical gaps (‘Test before Invest’ and ‘Training’), to foster synergies with other relevant stakeholders for the service/product development (‘Ecosystem’); options to fund potential R&D or investment projects as the last step for the scale-up of the tested solutions (‘Find Investment’). Therefore, the consortium expects to cover all the potential needs of the entities, prioritising SMEs, to help them reach market. Up to 1.624 complete services are expected to be given during the 3 years period to about 325 entities, including SMEs, start-ups and mid-caps, and public entities. Finally, mobilising new investment in the region to reach the digital transformation. The consortium (20 beneficiaries and 4 Affiliated Entities) is multisectoral and wide enough to cover the great diversity of application sectors of AI and robotics, and the territorial distribution in this extensive region, including representation of Research and Technology entities, Technological companies, Technological Parks and Entrepreneurial associations.
