NOTE:
The 'Type' field indicates whether the EDIH has received a 'Seal of Excellence', is an EDIH, or a DIH.
- 'EDIH' means the hub is part of the funded European Digital Innovation Hub network. It is co-funded by the European Commission and Member States/Associated Countries.
- 'Seal of Excellence' means the hub was evaluated positively in a European competitive call but is funded exclusively by national or regional resources.
- 'DIH' means digital innovation hubs with similar activities to EDIHs but not connected to the network.

Title: Basque Digital Innovation Hub: EDIH
Country: Spain
Description: The BDIH participation in the EDIH initiative and network is essential for the successful growth and transition of the BDIH into a powerhouse of collaborative tech development and adoption at the centre of European competitiveness to achieve a balanced transformation of Basque industry with the use of ever-advanced and secure technologies for future-proofing their competitiveness. The BDIH is a public-private collaboration network made up of a complex ecosystem of universities, technology centres, advanced vocational training centres and business R&D units, which connect their assets/infrastructures, laboratories, equipment, software, and scientific-technological capabilities (people) in the advanced manufacturing environment. Despite its young age, the BDIH is one of the European hubs with the largest number of members at 34, and has over 245 assets available. The BDIH catalogues the knowledge and technology available to its clients in 8 sub-structures called Nodes. These 8 nodes organise the network of assets – a combination of the infrastructure and the associated experts – into discrete services for companies in different fields of technologies and contexts. The implementation of the BDIH-EDIH sits across the three principal pillars of activity which represent the three strands of effective EDIH delivery: Service Provision, EDIH Integration and Strategy and Operations. The BDIH will directly support 360 SMEs and mid-caps in the adoption of digital technology solutions through the direct assessment of their business goals and the pairing of the right technical solutions, assets and expertise to meet theses. Through the already signed MOUs, the membership of existing DIH networks, the BDIH brings the best of Europe to its regional SMEs and will provide cross-DIH services and contribute as an active member of the EIDH with best practices, sector roadshows and support companies in achieving co-investment of over 3 million and 6 million in financing.
