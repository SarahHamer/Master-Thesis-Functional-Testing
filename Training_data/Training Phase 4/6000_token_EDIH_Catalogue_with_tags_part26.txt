EDIH Name: EDIH DIGICARE
Title: EDIH Digital Innovation for Healthcare (DIGICARE)
Country: Germany
Description: The main objective of the EDIH DigiCare is to create one of the central service hubs in Europe for digitalization with the focus on healthcare. All its services and values will primarily support two target groups: SMEs in the healthcare sector and healthcare providers. DigiCare aims to decrease time to market for products that foster innovation through digitalization and match these solutions to the needs of patients and healthcare providers through our services. To help digital products and services to get faster on the market we will support the SMEs from the idea, throughout funding, business model generation, development, testing and evaluation, implementation, certification to market access and product life cycle. By faster delivering new healthcare products and services matched with the needs of our healthcare system, economic situation, growing and aging population and technological development, we can assure better and greener healthcare services for the public domain, faster and cost-effective solutions for the healthcare providers and the patients.Within the four sectors testing before investing, support to find investment, training and skills development, and networking and access to innovation ecosystems several support solutions that are regionally already available will be scaled to EU wide access by the consortium. This includes services for an EU wide mass access e.g. community platforms and digital training as well as matchmaking platforms with large educational programs with digital packages as well as individual coaching, open innovation challenges and real-world lab assessments. The region of Erlangen-Nuremberg (Mittelfranken/Middle Franconia) is perfectly suited for the role of a hub for digitalization in healthcare as it is one of the leading spots for innovation according to the European Innovation Scoreboard. Especially its renowned industry, university, science, and healthcare providers have a leading position in innovation in healthcare.

EDIH Name: EDIH Digital Trust
Title: The European Digital Innovation Hub for digital trust and emerging digital technologies
Country: Liechtenstein
Description: With the adoption of digital technologies rapidly increasing, citizens are also leaving a stronger footprint in the digital world. At the same time, AI-based applications leverage the ability to integrate independent data trails from citizens for commercial use. But, this technological evolution is being ignited by the trend among customers to protect their data. Therefore: digital trust matters. The EDIH for Digital Trust in Liechtenstein aims to address this need for privacy by promoting digital innovations that set decentralization and data protection against centralization and intrusiveness. While data protection laws in Europe have often been resented as rigid, we see an exciting opportunity to promote digital technologies, solutions and business ideas that enable more digital trust between businesses, public institutions and citizens. That's why our EDIH focuses on four areas that inherently support this vision of greater digital trust: blockchain-/distributed ledger technology, regulation of emergent technologies, cybersecurity, and digital business model innovation. Our EDIH's service landscape covers the full SMEs journey from ideation through design/prototyping iterations to implementation of digital technologies and helping to find financing. The service landscape builds on the strong network of digital-liechtenstein.li, which offers leading expertise in the selected technological areas, accompanied by experience in supporting SMEs to implement digital technologies. Together, these strengths open up a fertile ground for SMEs to innovate, creating a competitive advantage for Europe in global markets.
