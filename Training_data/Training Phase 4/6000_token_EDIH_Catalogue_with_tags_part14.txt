Title: Digital Hub for Automotive and Aerospace
Country: Italy
Description: DAMAS (Digital innovation hub for AutoMotive and AeroSpace) was designated as a candidate to become an EDIH by the Italian Ministry of Economic Development (MISE). DAMAS is focused on two digital key technologies indicated by the Digital Europe Programme (DEP): HPC and AI. It is then specialised along the following digital enablers: Cloud & Edge computing; Big Data Analytics, High Performance Data analytics; Computational Fluid Dynamics; Virtual Reality/Augmented reality; Fast Prototyping including 3D printing; Additive manufacturing; Digital Twin Simulation & Modelling; Space Technologies - Geo Information and Sustainable Computing. Cybersecurity, a further DEP key technology, can be found among the capabilities of DAMAS partners but it was decided to activate structured collaborations with other EDIHs, to offer a full set of services in this domain, optimising DAMAS budget and focusing on core competencies. DAMAS is designed to act as one stop shop for SMEs, Mid-Caps and Large Enterprises that belong to the AutoMotive and Aerospace supply chains along with those PAs that use their products, supporting overall digital and green transformation. DAMAS vision relies on the increasing synergy between Automotive and Aerospace market segments. In that regard good examples coming from the US are Tesla and SpaceX, which have important economies of scale on digital technologies. DAMAS is based on a network of powerful HPC infrastructures that links together some of major Italian HPC systems both in terms of processing capabilities and in terms of storage, including the Leonardo DAVINCI-1 HPC system, the CINECA HPC systems and  CRS4, CINI and e-GEOS HPC facilities. DAMAS will establish a unique national-wide full-service one-stop-shop Automotive and Aerospace Innovation Hub for maximum coverage, leverage, impact and long-term sustainability in order to accelerate the uptake of AI and HPC technologies by Italian industries and to boost competitiveness and to foster new business models.

EDIH Name: DATAlife
Title: DATAlife
Country: Spain
Description: DATAlife is theDIH devoted to implementing artificial intelligence, big data and the technologies related, to the value chains of biotech, health, agrifood, sea-based industries and forestry.
DATAlife is organized under a scheme of Non-Profit organization, founded in October 2019
The solutions to the massive economic and social challenges the world faces are often found in the crossroad of different sectors like primarysector, industry and services, plus the deployment of disruptive technologies (Artificial Intelligence, High-Performance Computing, Internet of Things, and so on) and the involvement of the whole society, especially the triple-helix: Academia - Industry - Government.
This kind of challenges that appliesglobally is alsoclearly identified in European regions like Galicia, with a share of its economy focused on the primary sector, which has few leftchances to remain competitive in the international market arena. It is known,without a doubt, that this competitiveness increase will come through theimplementation of digital technologies.
In this process of uptake of digital technologies, artificial intelligence and data analytics appear as disruptive tools to boost companies´competitiveness, with a remarkable capability of impact in the quality of life and social wellbeing.
On the other hand, Galicia counts withinternationally-renowned scientific production in various fields such as biotechnology, healthcare, and smart technologies due to a vibrant University scene.
In this context, DATAlife has the vision of transforming Galicia into a leader European Bioregion, by the creation of a network of knowledge, infrastructure and technology. This network spins around the application of artificial intelligence, data analytics, internet of things, high-performance computing and cybersecurity to bioeconomy, sustainability and health.
To achieve this goal, DATAlife deploys a strategic plan made out of the following set of actions:

Catalogue of services. Based on the identified needs of every value chain plus the knowledge of DATAlife´s partners (industry clusters and RTOs with a long track record of servingthe ecosystem), a catalogue of services is defined with several initiatives alreadyidentified

DATAbeta: a set of services with a focus on collaborative development and enabling technologies that allow DATAlife to permanent validate its catalogue aligning it with the needs of the SMEs.
DATAchallenge: Program of Technological Challenges for each value chain.
DATAmarket: marketplace for visualization of technologies and services available in the region within the technological scope of DATAlife. This tool is also a facilitator ofmatches, boosting the integration of the ecosystem.
DATAopen: a program to create aLife Science DATA Platform for extraction, analysis and leverage of data with the scope of DATAlife´s value chains.
DATAlife´s catalogue of services is always under analysis and validation to assure its alignment with Galician SMEs´ needs. This way, DATAlife will include services for test-before-invest, shared labs and infrastructures and technology acquisition when needed.


Communication activity. The actions deployed under the communication plan serve as dissemination of DATAlife´s activity but also as a raising-awareness service to promote the digitalization within the ecosystem to assure that every single stakeholder of the community understands the advantages that digital transformation brings.
Network effect. DATAlife´s partners have a unique and strong international network in their respective activity areas, due to their prolonged presence in the international project arena. DATAlife acts as a connector between Galicia and the Galician ecosystem, providing the possibility to be part of international joint projects.
