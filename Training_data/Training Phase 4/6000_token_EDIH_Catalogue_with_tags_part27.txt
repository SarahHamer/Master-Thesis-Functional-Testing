EDIH Name: EDIH NEB
Title: EDIH Northern and Eastern Bohemia
Country: Czechia
Description: The main objective of EDIH NEB is to support the digital transformation of SMEs, start-ups, mid-caps, and public entities and to create the best possible conditions to ensure the long-term commercial success of all those involved by increasing their competitiveness, capacity for action, and effectiveness in processes, products, or services that use advanced digital technologies EDIH NEB is a significant part of the innovation infrastructure in the Liberec and Hradec KrÃ¡lovÃ© regions (CZ05 Northeast). In this respect, the natural industrial and research centres that are the cities of Liberec and Hradec KrÃ¡lovÃ© are important European hubs of support for research, development, and innovation. Moreover, the Liberec region is a world leader in the development of industrial technologies for the production of nanomaterials and related nanotechnologies. EDIH NEB concentrates on digitisation and artificial intelligence in connection with digital modelling, the simulation of technological processes, sensor technology, etc. The coverage of cooperation and services by the EDIH NEB consortium has 4 geographical dimensions. EDIH NEB primarily targets the territory of the Liberec and the Hradec KrÃ¡lovÃ© Region. The second catchment dimension of the unique and other digitisation services on offer is the rest of the Czech Republic. The third entirely fundamental geographical dimension, one which is absolutely unique within the Czech Republic in light of the geographical position of the Liberec and Hradec KrÃ¡lovÃ© regions in the border region with Poland and Germany, is expansion of the quality cooperation already in existence as part of what is known as Euroregion Nisa, and to some extent Euroregion Glacensis (Saxony, Lower Silesia, Opole). The fourth geographical dimension to the cooperation, exchange of experience, and offer of services which the EDIH NEB consortium brings takes the shape of other foreign cooperation within the territory of the EU, or indeed worldwide.

EDIH Name: EDIH NN
Title: European Digital Innovation Hub Northern Netherlands
Country: Netherlands
Description: The Northern Netherlands (NN) finds itself at the junction of all the big transitions. Digitalisation is essential to follow through with these. Considering this, our region has the potential to make sizeable progress if it can successfully roll out widespread digitalisation. 
As a hardcore transition economy, the NN may even join the European frontrunners and act as an example for other regions. It is from this challenge that the NN will start with the European Digital Innovation Hub (EDIH NN). We have chosen to specialise in the area of Autonomous Systems, which includes multiple digital technologies that are relevant for the four transitions in the NN: (1) Smart Agro, (2) Smart Manufacturing, (3) Life Science and Health and (4) Utilities, Built Environment and Mobility. In the first three-year EDIH NN wants to support more than 750 companies and lay the foundation for long-term support of all companies. 
The building blocks for EDIH NN are: 

A Brokerage network that will identify issues regarding digitalisation and relay these to Solution Providers (high TRL) and knowledge providers (low TRL).
A Test Before Invest network (test and demo facilities) comprising 20+ organisations that will invest in Autonomous Systems within their domain, and collaborate towards becoming a European testing ground.
A Smart Factory Accelerator to strengthen the digital maturity of companies.
An Empowerment programme to strengthen companies in the areas of DEP Technologies: Cyber Security and Artificial Intelligence.
An approach based on High Performance Computing to make digitalisation more accessible.
The Smart Makers Academy: A programme aimed at matching supply and demand around digital skills, based on individual learning outcomes.
A Funding Readiness programme to help companies that need to invest for their digitalisation strategy, in finding funding opportunities.
A network to stimulate supply and demand around Autonomous Systems.

EDIH Name: EDIH OVA
Title: EDIH Ostrava
Country: Czechia
Description: The project of the European Digital Innovation Hub Ostrava (EDIH Ostrava) is designed to accelerate the digitalisation of companies and public organizations in the region and at the same time to offer an attractive opportunity to use the unique interconnection of digital infrastructure and know-how to interested companies, especially small and medium-sized enterprises in the EU. The technological specialization of EDIH Ostrava is tied to the core facility of High-Performance Computing (HPC), complemented by an experimental industrial testbed. These capacities will be primarily aimed at testing and experimentation of challenging tasks for cases in sectors related to the implementation of the Industry 4.0 concept. This "technological" DNA of EDIH Ostrava is further naturally determined by the industrial character of the Moravian-Silesian Region (MSR), where EDIH Ostrava will mainly operate. The project includes a comprehensive offer of individual services and other activities in line with the required functions of the European Digital Innovation Hub. The aim is to cover a wide range of stakeholders with regard to their level of digital readiness, from entities not yet determined to exploit the potential of digitalisation to entities ready to use the most advanced digital techniques and state-of-the-art research infrastructure, including HPC. Implementation of EDIH Ostrava will provide a significant upgrade the activities that this hub has been gradually developing for several years. An ambition of EDIH Ostrava is to become an inspirational and useful hub within the networks to which EDIH Ostrava is or will be linked. This ambition builds on the existing activities of both members of the consortium and their role within the regional, national, and European innovation ecosystem and is reflected, among others, in the expected share of clients outside the MSR region.
