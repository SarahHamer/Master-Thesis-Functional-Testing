EDIH Name: DEDIHCATED BFC
Title: DEvelop Digital Innovation Hub to Create and Accompany new Trends in European inDustries in Bourgogne-Franche-Comté
Country: France
Description: DEDIHCATED BFC is the EDIH for the Burgundy-Franche-Comté region (BFC). The BFC region is the leading French region in terms of industrial employment with strong specificities: automotive, transport and mobility, mechanics, mechatronics, plastics, agri-food, and energy. Despite a high-quality regional digital offer and skills, industrial SMEs are far from digitalization, due to fragmentation between the different regional structures and programmes, not very structured and organised links between digital and application market players, and lack of availability of skills in these areas.
The project create a one-stop-shop hub for industrial companies for their digital transition by offering them support and new services at reduced prices. DEDIHCATED BFC propose an innovative and added value approach based on the delivery of services in the form of an integrated pathway. Three thematic journeys have been designed in line with the industrial needs and a cybersecurity package :
1) From data to Artificial Intelligence for company management;
2) Digitalisation of business processes and production to the digital twin ;
3) Business skills training.
In addition to these advances services, and in view to meet the needs of SMEs far from the digitalisation, entry-level services (awareness, DMA, and basic services) will serve at entry-point of the hub.
Bringing together 13 partners, DEDIHCATED BFC ensure both a good access to the industrial SMEs in all the targeted sectors and in all the geographical areas; and a technological expertise and infrastructures to deliver the services.

Therefore, the defence economy has a cross-cutting and significant impact on the digitalization of the economy and the society.
Defence4Tech (D4T) gathers a public agency, a cluster manager, universities and research centres, and the armed forces research centres to promote the digitalization of the defence economy, in particular SMEs, which are at the core of the Portuguese economy.
D4T will have as its centerpiece a platform that will be a showcase for the services provided, and for the training activities offer. It will also work as a matchmaking tool and a hub for the dissemination of relevant information.
Several other activities will be implemented to enlarge the scope of potential beneficiaries.
Test before invest activities will be integrated in a broader line of services to support digital products development. This includes support to product specification, product development, simulation and validation, prototyping and operational experimentation and testing in real environment.
Promoting skills and training will also be a relevant activity, as the consortium integrates two engineering universities and other entities with experience in providing specialized training in digital skills.
Activities to promote innovation in the ecosystem and networking but also to support investment finding are part of the mission of the public agency and the cluster manager that integrate the consortium.
D4T activities are in line with other national, European and NATO policies. Several MoU with other EDIH that provide a high complementarity were established and partnerships with other entities will be developed.

EDIH Name: DIBI
Title: Digital Innovation for Bavarian Industry
Country: Germany
Description: DIBI focuses on the digitalization of the manufacturing industry as one of the most important economic sectors in Bavaria - despite progressive structural change. Its share amounts to more than 30% of GNP and it strongly affects other sectors. About 87% of the companies here are SMEs. They face severe transformation challenges due to digitalization, decarbonization, decrease of combustion drives, energy shortage, shortage of skilled staff and increase of costs. A second focus of the DIBI consortium lies on digital transformation of public authorities which still lack behind and hinder sustainable and citizen-friendly operations. Thus, DIBI aims to support manu-facturing-oriented companies (SMEs and small mid-caps), start-ups, and public organizations in Bavaria by stimulating, enabling, and accelerating digital innovations and therefore foster competitiveness and sustaina-ble solutions. The eight partners of EDIH DIBI consortium located in North, West and South of Bavaria are close to the customers in whole Bavaria. DIBI provides a portfolio of 100+ client services distributed over four cus-tomer-centric work packages and focusing on Analytics and AI, Digital powered Manufacturing and Cyber Re-silience. Already 64 services of them are available at project start and can be provided to other EDIHs on de-mand. Every service type is specified in a detailed price list (annex 1). Strong synergies will be leveraged by a structured collaboration with EEN Bavaria2Europe, also coordinated by BI. Pre-existing collaborations with a significant number of (E)DIHs have already established European corridors which can be built upon. KPIs are set to indicate the progress in numbers of served clients with basic/advanced services, while qualitative excel-lence will be monitored continuously. We expect significant long-term impact on the competitiveness of our target customers by providing knowledge transfer and skills development as well as test-based decisions for investments.
