EDIH Name: Global Alliance for Media Innovation (GAMI)
Title: Global Alliance for Media Innovation (GAMI)
Country: France
Description: Global Alliance for Media Innovation is the network for innovation within the World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers (WAN-IFRA). WAN-IFRA’s members are located in over 120 countries and have a combined reach of more than 18,000 publications, 15,000 online sites and 3,000 companies. Following the launch of the Global Alliance for Media Innovation during WAN-IFRA’s World Congress in June 2014, we have established a brain trust of stakeholders involved in research and innovation for news media. The core of this group is composed of pioneers, media organisations (publishers and suppliers), and academic research labs dealing with technology transfer and research programmes in Europe (Norway, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, UK), the Americas (Brazil, USA, Canada), and Southeast Asia (Singapore, Japan). The Alliance was formed because its members all believe that our industry requires a reliable flood of new technologies, products and business models. We see the future of news media being invented right now, all around the globe, by hundreds of different companies, universities and entrepreneurs. But their separate efforts, research, prototypes and rollouts receive inconsistent attention and analysis. Many good ideas fail simply due to a lack of development support, while others get hyped beyond their real value. Vital lessons and examples are not being widely enough or rapidly enough disseminated. GAMI focuses on five main topic areas relevant to the future of news media companies, news professionals, and news consumers: New platforms/distribution channels: mobility, wear-ability, the Internet of Things (smart cities, connected homes, connected cars, connected devices); New forms of narrative and storytelling: immersive content, VR, 360° video, social media; Data exploration: big data, data visualisation, automatic generation of content; Technology enablers: privacy, security; Multiple media convergence: interoperability, standards (IPTC, etc.) GAMI is guided by an Advisory Board representing news media or media labs, suppliers, research centres, universities, technology clusters and accelerators.

EDIH Name: Green eDIH
Title: Green Digital Innovation HUB
Country: Romania
Description: Green eDIH aims to ensure the support and the easy transition to new technologies and digital innovation, for small and large companies in any industry. The mission of Green eDIH is to create a bridge between the current digitalization needs of the regional industry and the eco-friendly solutions. The values that mark the way in which Green eDIH operates are: Green Technology is not a goal, it is a Standard that must be implemented. INDUSTRY-LEADING INNOVATION is not an Objective, it is the intrinsic essence that was the basis of the entire digital construction. We do not promote innovation, we create it at a high-standard level. TRANSPARENCY in COLLABORATION is the key to any association, but the essence is the continuous and constant flow of informational and decision-making visibility. That is, we will replace the classic Reporting. In us, we TRUST– each piece of the Digital Green eDIH Puzzle is a unique and equivalent valuable entity that blends organically and fluidly into the digital ecosystem. Green eDIH acts as a catalyst that brings together academy, private companies, central and local authorities and investors to make green digital transformation a reality. Green Digital Innovation HUB is interested in participating in the development of regional, national or European political initiatives to digitize the industry. As experts, we were involved in the development of the RIS3 strategy at the national level, regarding the smart specialization. Green Digital Innovation HUB is a member of the Digital Working Group of the Harnessing Talent Platform (HTP), an initiative of the European Commission of the Talent Stimulation Mechanism, which will support affected EU regions in training, retaining and attracting the skills and competences needed to overcome the impact of the accelerated decline of the working population. At the same time, we are also members of the DIH2, Bowi, Tetramax, and FundingBox networks, and we actively participate in events organized at the European level in the field of technology for the development of standards and policies for technologies such as blockchain, AI, DML or any other technology.
