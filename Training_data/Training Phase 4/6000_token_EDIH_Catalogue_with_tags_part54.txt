EDIH Name: Sirris Hub - Additive Manufacturing Integrated Factory
Title: Sirris Hub - Additive Manufacturing Integrated Factory
Country: Belgium
Description: Additive manufacturing (AM) – or commonly referred to as 3D printing – of metallic mechanical components has become a reality. No longer is 3D printing restricted to the domain of plastics and prototyping. Production of fully functional mechanical components is state-of-the-art. However, additive technology does not yet reach the level of precision (dimensional accuracy, surface finish, etc.) required of such components. Post processing steps, like precision milling operations, are necessary but offer great challenges since printed components often have irregular free-form shapes and thus are not easy to set references, clamp, automate, handle, etc. The DIH addresses the need of the local industry for practical and advanced knowledge on how to integrate the state-of-the-art additive manufacturing, post machining technology, quality control and flexible automation. The DIH is based on the continuous development and exploration of an application lab. The lab will become fully operational in November 2017 and will contain a 3D metal powder bed printer, a five axis precision milling machine, 2 coordinate measuring machines, a femto second laser texturing machine and smart automation solutions. The services of the DIH are: • Industrial feasibility studies • Research projects for industry • Sensibilisation and inspiration for new technologies • Training, Master Classes • Making the bridge between new technologies and industry
