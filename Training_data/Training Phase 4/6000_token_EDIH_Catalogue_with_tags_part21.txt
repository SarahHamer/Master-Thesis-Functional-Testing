EDIH Name: DIH4CAT
Title: Catalonia Digital Innovation Hub (DIH4CAT)
Country: Spain
Description: DIH4CAT targets Catalan SMEs (with a special focus on manufacturing companies and technology providers), technology start-ups, and public administrations. Catalonia has a strong industrial base, with 35,339 companies (99% SMEs) which represent 18,1% of Spanish industrial enterprises. Data from 2019 shows that only 16% of those companies had adopted advanced digital technologies. Additionally, Catalonia counts more than 1,700 start-ups, (66% of Industry 4.0), facing challenges such as access to technology infrastructure, time to market and investment. In this context the Digital Innovation Hub of Catalonia (DIH4CAT) is born, as a non-profit regional innovation ecosystem formed by the main agents supporting digitisation in Catalonia and connecting the main technology infrastructure of the region to make them available for SMEs, start-ups, and public administration, with the objective of accelerating technology transformation towards a more green and digital industry. The consortium is led by the Government of Catalonia and composed of 7 technology partners (RTOs and university) leading the 7 technology areas (AI, HPC, Cybersecurity, Robotics, Photonics, 3D Printing and Connectivity), 1 business school, 2 employer’s industrial associations. It is complemented with 19 Associated Partners so far which include, among others, private companies contributing with infrastructure and know-how. DIH4CAT has a clear focus on test before invest services but complements its offer with services related to innovation, ecosystem, digital skills, access to finance and business. The Consortium has also a very well-defined collaboration strategy at an international level, developed through the presence in most relevant European networks, participation in more than 50 previous relevant projects, 5 MoUs specifically developed for this call, to develop common infrastructures/services, and seamless collaboration with EEN (Catalan node is also coordinated by ACCIÓ).

EDIH Name: DIH4Society
Title: Digital Innovation Hub for a Smarter, Safer and more Sustainable Society (DIH4Society)
Country: Romania
Description: News: 
 launched the call for selecting the SMEs who will benefit from the services. Details & info are available: https://dih4society.ro/apel-imm/
Accelerating digital green transformation and innovation uptake across the economy and society is at the forefront of Europe’s growth agenda. Digital Innovation Hubs (DIHs) are one of the pillars to uphold this process and will help to consider the geographical (regional) dimension and thematic context to boost SME growth, citizen centered governance, jobs and investment. The COVID19 crisis has demonstrated the absolute necessity of having strong European digital ecosystems as key enablers to avoid disruption in value-chains. However, digitalization and digital transformation can only be efficient if digital ecosystems are strongly interlinked with their applied market sectors. Due to inertia and/or legacy, the manufacturing, public administration and health sectors are among the most challenging ones. The project Digital Innovation Hub for Society for a Smarter, Safer and more Sustainable Society comes to upscale the services that DIH4Society can deliver in the North-West Region of Romania and aims at fully integrating our initiative into the European network of hubs. The project focuses on two technological pillars, cybersecurity and smart robotics, while also building advanced digital competencies for digitalization and green digital transformation. Upon finalization, the project will have a profound, transformative impact on a regional level through the digital progression of 70 key stakeholders, public administration and health providers, and more than 400 SMEs from smart specialization sectors. DIH4Society will provide a European solution to a European challenge and will bring or embed digitalization in the practices of many organizations. In the long run the project will inspire a new generation of early adopters of technologies, new entrepreneurial initiatives of visionary companies and organizations that use cutting edge technologies at the core of their business models and will build the foundation for a citizen centered public service delivery.
