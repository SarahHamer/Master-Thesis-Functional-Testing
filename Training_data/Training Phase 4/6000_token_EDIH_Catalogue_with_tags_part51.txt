EDIH Name: PTCentroDiH
Title: Digital Innovation Hub da Região Centro
Country: Portugal
Description: PTCentroDIH aims to support the Digital and Green transition of the SMEs and Public Administration of the Centro Region of Portugal, by acting as a one-stop-shop to foster competitiveness, innovation and territorial cohesion in the region. PTCentroDiH’s consortium comprises 21 partners from the Centro Region, namely the 4 Competitiveness Clusters, the 3 Universities, the 6 Polytechnic Institutes and the leading R&D Centres from the Region. The consortium has deep knowledge about the Region’s innovation ecosystem and truly understands the existing offer and needs in terms of digital transformation services, being in a highly favourable position to provide services that are fully aligned with the real needs and demands of the targeted local entities. With a solid Foundation on Advanced Digital Technologies Application, PTCentroDiH will have a transversal approach in terms of digital technologies and will provide a set of services not often used by the local entities, especially SMEs and the Public Sector. PTCentroDiH’s service portfolio, namely “Test before invest”, “Skills and training”, “Support to find investment”, and “Innovation ecosystem and networking”, will be highly innovative for the local entities, who are not used to having extended access to these types of services. PTCentroDiH will ensure that all the companies from the Centro Region will have similar opportunities to access multiple services, ensuring that every company, whether small or large, high-tech or not, will not be left behind in the digital and green transformation. PTCentroDiH strategy is being developed in collaboration with the Authority for the Development of the Centro Region of Portugal (CCRDC) to guarantee the HUB will significantly contribute to increasing the competitiveness and innovation across different sectors and fields of activity in the region.
