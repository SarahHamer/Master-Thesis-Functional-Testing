EDIH Name: PIAP HUB
Title: PIAP HUB
Country: Poland
Description: Ever since PIAP’s origins in 1965 it’s role was to introduce new technologies to industry. PIAP acknowledges the low level of digitalisation in Polish manufacturing companies relative to other European countries and wants to facilitate the upcoming boom in this field in the Mazovian Region and in the whole country. Nowadays PIAP helps companies in the region become more competitive by improving their business/production processes as well as products (and services) by means of digital technology. This is being achieved by offered support with expertise and infrastructure, consulting and training services.
PIAP’s established role of competence centre for robotics, automation and measurements for industrial purposes has been accompanied by a number of services based on the expertise such as technology audits, technology scouting and technology brokering. By runnig a Hub in Warsaw PIAP intends to extend its impact to the SME sector by offering services to companies which currently have a relatively low level of digitisation and which do not have the resources or personnel to address the digitisation challenge.

The hub has access to a number of labs used for scientific and commercial purposes. These are being integrated in processes supporting business in order introduce the one-stop-shop principle. Our goal is to have the capacity to offer companies possibilities to test and experiment with technologies. To support the technology providers and users to carry out an experiment and to test whether the proposed approach would indeed be beneficial for the user. At the same time this experiment can be useful for the provider that has an early customer and can adapt the technology to the needs of a certain class of users.

Technologies developed by PIAP, its partners and clients may take advantage of PIAP’s commercialization good practices offered in the form of supporting service. Upon request they will be subject to commercialization potential evaluation by PIAP special purpose vehicle PIAP-Scientech Sp. z o.o.. The methodology developed in cooperation with an SPV of the Warsaw University of Technology will be applied. If the technologies show potential of commercialization, the process will be launched and the success fee will be distributed among parties involved in commercialization and R&D. Several networks and organizations (National Chamber o Commerce, Polish Institute of Technology, VCs and intermediaries running investment opportunities scans) will be involved in the process. Playing the role core partner in PIAP HUB Fundingbox Accelerator Sp. z o.o. provide access to cascade funding, acceleration andincubation programs and cascade funding distribution.
The role of the animator of the hub will be not only to offer its expertise and resources but most of all to integrate the potential of the whole ecosystem of public and private labs, technology and service providers. Hundreds of project implemented by PIAP resulted in a great network of partners from all sector. Their potential will add to the background PIAP already has and result in creation of a vibrant hub participating in international networks and national initiatives.

EDIH Name: POLYTRONICS
Title: Innovation Hub for Smart Polymers and Digital Technologies
Country: France
Description: Polytronics is dedicated to supporting SMEs in their digital transition, in respect of Artificial Intelligence (AI), with a focus on the polymer industry: plastics, textiles, elastomers & rubbers, composites. Indeed, these industries are often traditional and conservative (notably in the textile sector with quite often production machines lacking mere sensors) yet suffer from the lack of data exploitation even though their manufacturing lines may be equipped with sensors. Polytronics aims to help companies in the polymers industry in their digital maturity by leveraging the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) based on exploitable data from their products and manufacturing processes. Polytronics gathers 7 specialists in AI, robotics, data management and exploitation, 3 partners specialised in sensors integration, 2 partners specialised in mechatronics to support proofs of concept in industry, 5 technical centers specialised in targeted polymer sectors, and 2 innovation clusters. Experts in polymers will support AI experts in understanding and adapting the needs and pain point of the SMEs in the polymer industry. Therefore, SMEs will benefit from the crossed expertise to facilitate the implementation of AI in their business, without negative disruption of their business. Polytronics dedicate 70% of its budget, 3.3M€ over 3 years to the provision of services to SMEs. Besides this core activity, Polytronics partners will merge and update its website and two key platform, a marketplace and a knowledge management platform, to implement a web portal which will be the one-stop-shop for SMEs, therefore facilitating their access and user journey. This web portal will allow notably gathering data and indicators to feed the DTA with the digital maturity evolution of the polymer sector targeted by Polytronics. Finally, clustering activities, communication and dissemination will allow implicating Polytronics in the whole EDIH network.
